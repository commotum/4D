Description: This dataset provides 3D object-based stimuli and rotation images for studying mental rotation performance, extending the classic paradigm introduced by Shepard and Metzler (1971). The dataset is structured into four main categories of stimuli: 8-Cube Rotations, 8-Cube Mirrored Rotations, 10-Cube Rotations, and 10-Cube Mirrored Rotations.
(Citation: Shepard, R. N., & Metzler, J. (1971). Mental rotation of three-dimensional objects. Science, 171(3972), 701-703.)

8-Cube Rotations: Shapes labeled A–O, each with 14 rotated images (e.g., 8A0, 8A1 … 8A14). Images are available in .jpg format.

8-Cube Mirrored Rotations: Shapes labeled A–O, each with 14 rotated images (e.g., 8A0_m, 8A1_m … 8A14_m). The “0 Mirror” shape (e.g., 8A0_m) is a vertical reflection of the default 8A0 stimulus. Files are provided in .jpg format.

10-Cube Rotations: Shapes labeled A–O, each with 14 rotated images (e.g., A0, A1 … A14) in .jpg format.

10-Cube Mirrored Rotations: Shapes labeled A–O, each with 14 rotated images (e.g., A0_m, A1_m … A14_m). The “0 Mirror” (A0_m) is a vertical reflection of the default A0. Files are available in .jpg format.

Additionally, the dataset includes example folders (e.g., X, X_m, Y, Y_m). Each contains rotated versions of the corresponding shape (X0–X14, Y0–Y14) in .jpg format. These examples are intended for researchers to present as practice stimuli before beginning the main experiment, providing participants with exposure to the types of objects they may encounter. The main experimental stimuli are more varied and may feature greater complexity.

Methodology: The dataset was developed as part of a simulated mental rotation task (MRT). Stimuli were created on Autodesk Inventor by constructing 30 three-dimensional (3D) cube-based objects, half composed of 10 cubes and the other half of 8 cubes. For each 3D object, a two-dimensional reference image was generated at a fixed rotation. From each reference, 14 rotated versions were created by applying 45-degree increments along horizontal and vertical axes. This process produced 30 reference images and 420 corresponding rotated images, yielding 450 total stimuli.

A separate validation study was conducted via Qualtrics using participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Each trial presented an image pair: a reference image on the left and either (a) a rotated version of the same object, (b) a distractor object, or (c) the identical reference image. Distractors were drawn from the remaining 29 reference objects, balanced between those with the same cube count and a different cube count. Participants had 10 seconds to respond “same” or “different” for each pair. To ensure data quality, trials were interspersed with validation pairs (reference–reference), and participants who failed these validation checks were excluded. Stimuli difficulty was calculated using the mean hit rate across participants.
