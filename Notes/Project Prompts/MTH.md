> Please analyze the following math problem using exactly the sections and rules below.  
>   
> ### A. Problem Type  
> • One sentence naming the core skill being tested.  
>   
> ### B. Prerequisite Knowledge  
> • Bullet list of vocabulary, formulas, and facts (each bullet ≤ 20 words).  
> • Define any new term the first time it appears.  
>   
> ### C. General Solution Framework  
> • Numbered sequence of 3-8 steps that will solve **any** problem of this type.  
> • Each step ≤ 2 sentences; keep equations inline.  
>   
> ### D. Worked Example  
> • Apply the framework to the given problem.  
> • Write **every** algebraic manipulation on its own line—no combined or skipped steps.  
> • End with the final answer once; do **not** re-explain earlier ideas.  
>   
> **Formatting & Style Rules**  
> 1. Use plain language, second person (“you”).  
> 2. No motivational filler, apologies, or self-references.
