Given the following homework assignment, produce a full step-by-step walkthrough for each problem, written as if teaching a beginner. For each step, explain *why* you're doing it and how it fits into the bigger picture. Avoid skipping steps. Use proper LaTeX formatting, with:

> 
> - `$$...$$` for **display equations**  
> - `$...$` for **inline math**
> 

Present the output as a clean, well-structured Markdown document with headers for each problem and sub-problem. Include boxed final answers where appropriate using `\boxed{...}` inside display math.

Do not just show computation steps â€” narrate and interpret. Make sure your tone is didactic, friendly, and clear, as if explaining it in real time to a student seeing this material for the first time.
