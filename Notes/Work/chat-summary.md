You're right — the instructor **does NOT literally pull up your old report and compare them side-by-side.**
But the Capstone instructions **do require** you to *improve the experiment*, and the grader checks for those improvements *in your new report itself*, not by comparing documents.

Here’s the clean reality:

---

# ✅ **They don’t compare your reports. They evaluate whether your Capstone shows improvement on its own.**

They are looking for:

### **1. Evidence that you improved the experiment YOU chose**

Not because they’re comparing papers, but because the Capstone prompt explicitly says:

> *“Redo a lab from this term to meet the original objective, **designing and executing a comprehensive experiment**… you will be expected to **make improvements in all aspects of the experiment**.”*
>

So the burden is on **your Capstone** to demonstrate:

* better design
* better data
* better analysis
* better clarity
* better uncertainty handling

They judge the Capstone **alone**, but the Capstone must **show improvement**.

---

# ✅ **2. You are graded against the Capstone rubric, not your earlier lab**

They won’t dock you for something you did or didn’t do in the original lab.

They *will* dock you if your Capstone:

* Has too little data
* Has weak or missing uncertainty analysis
* Doesn’t use proper graphing (scatter only, labeled, units, R², trendline)
* Doesn’t show a quantitative prediction
* Doesn’t include a clear model + variable definitions
* Doesn’t have a reproducible procedure
* Doesn’t analyze whether the model is supported
* Doesn’t reflect on improvements

All of that comes purely from the Capstone expectations.

---

# ✅ **3. “Improvements” means better than what the original lab handout required**

NOT better than what *you* originally turned in.

Your Capstone should look like:

* A more professional experiment
* More trials
* A broader range of variable values
* More rigorous uncertainty handling
* Clearer diagrams
* Cleaner procedure
* Better analysis and justification

You won’t be docked for what you *previously* did.
You get docked if your Capstone **doesn’t look like an improved experiment** by normal scientific standards.

---

# 🔍 **So what does “improvement” actually look like in practice?**

Improvements usually mean:

### **Better design**

* More levels of the independent variable
* More trials
* Tighter controls
* Cleaner measurement techniques
* Better written procedure

### **Better data**

* Uncertainty in every measurement
* Quadrature where appropriate
* Error bars
* Sufficient sample size

### **Better analysis**

* Linearization if needed
* Trendline + equation + R²
* Correct axes, units, labels
* Sample calculations
* Stronger reasoning

### **Better conclusions**

* Direct comparison to the model
* Using uncertainty to justify conclusions
* Addressing unexpected results

If those show up in your Capstone, you satisfy the “improvement” requirement even if the instructor never looks at your Lab 6 file.

---

# ⭐ **In short:**

They don’t compare your actual Lab 6 submission.
They judge your Capstone by whether **it clearly demonstrates a high-quality experiment** and **hits all Capstone requirements**.

If you want, I can help you design a Capstone experiment that **hits every high-value grading target**, so you’re guaranteed not to get docked.
