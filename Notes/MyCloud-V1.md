"In the contemporary landscape of digital technology and communication, the domain of applications, operating systems, and cloud services is markedly characterized by a state of fragmentation due to the incompatibility, uncooperativeness, and anticompetitive practices of major tech corporations. These entities, prioritizing their proprietary interests, have fostered a digital environment rife with siloed ecosystems and limited interoperability. This approach has led to a landscape where applications and programs are often deliberately designed to be non-interoperable, undermining collaborative potential and reinforcing segregated technological domains."

HBO MAX recently removed one of its original franchise series, Westworld, in order to cut costs on royalties. OpenAI recently nerfed ChatGPT disallowing it from discussing certain topics in order to provide more woke/politically correct application. First Republic Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and many others went under after available funds were insufficient to match customer withdrawals. The United States continuously provides "relief" cash injections, causing inflation and the devaluation of currency. Equifax, the credit reporting agency, experienced a significant data breach, resulting in the theft of names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and driver's license numbers of hundreds of millions of people.

What is a word to describe this phenomena?

Please write a short abstract for a paper titled "Core Functions of Computers, Social Networks, and Applications" that suggests a new framework (similar to Vanevar Bush's "As We May Think," J.C.R. Licklider's "Man Computer Symbiosis," and Doug Engelbart's "Augmenting Human Intellect") outlining the core functions as follows:

Store / Host / Safeguard / Backup / Fortify / Relay / Ensure

Discover / Explore / Search / Browse / Scroll / Roam / Traverse / Read / View

It should be written as a response/solution to the fractured application/OS/cloud landscape that arises naturally from non cooperative and centralized control structures maliciously used by Big Tech, National Governments, and Corporations.

Abstract:

Title: Take Back Your Screen, Take Charge of Your Life
Title: Core Functions of Computers, Social Networks, and Applications

In the modern era of digital communication and computing, the landscape of applications, operating systems, and cloud services is increasingly characterized by fragmentation, and  centralized control. This paper proposes a new, integrative framework for understanding and harnessing the core functions of computers, social networks, and applications. Drawing inspiration from seminal works such as Vannevar Bush's "As We May Think," J.C.R. Licklider's "Man-Computer Symbiosis," and Doug Engelbart's "Augmenting Human Intellect," this framework aims to address the challenges posed by the non-cooperative and centralized structures prevalent in Big Tech, national governments, and corporations.

The framework is structured around key functional categories:

Foundation Operations - encompassing Store, Host, Safeguard, Backup, Fortify, Relay, and Ensure. These operations form the bedrock of digital systems, emphasizing robustness, resilience, and reliability in data management and communication.
Creative and Organizational Processes - involving Create, Edit, Modify, Prototype, Assemble, Organize, Catalogue, Remember, and Build. This category focuses on the generative and structural aspects of digital interaction, promoting innovation and systematic organization of information.
Communication and Dissemination Mechanisms - including Broadcast, Publish, Share, Announce, Present, Connect, Communicate, and Propagate. These mechanisms highlight the dissemination of information and ideas, fostering connectivity and interaction within and across digital platforms.
Exploration and Discovery Tools - comprising Discover, Explore, Search, Browse, Scroll, Roam, Traverse, Read, and View. This group emphasizes the user’s engagement with digital content, encouraging exploratory behavior and the pursuit of knowledge.
Analytical and Operational Techniques - consisting of Sift, Process, Investigate, Authenticate, Automate, Operate, Optimize, and Compute. These techniques underscore the critical role of analysis, verification, and efficiency in processing information.
Our proposed framework not only delineates these core functionalities but also advocates for an open, cooperative model of development and governance. This model challenges the current paradigm of centralized control and seeks to democratize the digital ecosystem. By promoting interoperability, user autonomy, and ethical standards, the framework aims to realign technological advancements with the foundational ideals of the internet and personal computing—openness, collaboration, and empowerment.

The paper concludes with a call to action for developers, policymakers, and users to embrace this framework, fostering a digital environment that is more inclusive, versatile, and aligned with human-centric values. This shift is crucial in navigating the complexities of the digital age, ensuring that technological progress serves the broader interests of society and upholds the principles of digital democracy.
