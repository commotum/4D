| Term                                        | Meaning in CSP-Rules                                                                                                                                 | Relation to general CSP terminology                                                                |

| **candidate (cand)**                        | A possible value for a CSP variable that has not yet been eliminated. Stored in the `candidate` template with status `cand`.                         | Standard CSP notion of an element of a variable’s **domain** that is still viable.                 |
| **c-value**                                 | A candidate whose value has been **asserted** (fixed) during solving; same template but status `c-value`.                                            | Equivalent to a **decided value** or **assigned variable** in CSP; removed from the candidate set. |
| **g‑candidate**                             | A “grouped candidate” representing a set of basic candidates that act together (e.g., all instances of a digit in a row). Used in advanced patterns. | Corresponds to grouped variables/values in CSP reasoning (e.g., subsets, grouped constraints).     |
| **label**                                   | Numeric identifier for a candidate (encodes variable + value). Ensures uniqueness and supports linking.                                              | Similar to an internal **index** for variable-value pairs in many CSP implementations.             |
| **context**                                 | Identifier for a hypothetical solving branch; `0` is the main context, others are used for T\&E or nested reasoning.                                 | Mirrors the concept of **search nodes** or **assumption levels** in backtracking CSP solvers.      |
| **constraint**                              | Relation restricting simultaneous assignments of certain labels. Encoded through “links” or higher‑level structures.                                 | Directly the same as standard CSP constraints.                                                     |
| **link (contradiction link)**               | Binary relation indicating two candidates cannot both be true (mutual exclusion).                                                                    | In CSP, this is a **binary constraint** or an entry in the conflict graph.                         |
| **strong link**                             | A link where the two candidates are the only remaining options for a variable or structure: exactly one must be true.                                | Known as a **strong edge** or **bi-directional implication** in constraint graphs.                 |
| **weak link**                               | A simple contradiction link: at most one candidate can be true, but both may be false.                                                               | Matches the usual **mutual exclusion** relationship.                                               |
| **chain**                                   | Ordered sequence of alternating strong and weak links used to propagate implications or reach contradictions.                                        | Analogous to inference chains in CSP reasoning and SAT solvers.                                    |
| **whip**                                    | A specific linear chain ending in a contradiction that justifies eliminating a target candidate.                                                     | Comparable to resolution chains or forcing chains used for deterministic eliminations.             |
| **braid**                                   | More complex chain allowing controlled branching, but still ending in a contradiction.                                                               | Related to inference trees or multi-path reasoning in CSP.                                         |
| **subset**                                  | Rule family exploiting groups of candidates (e.g., naked/hidden pairs, triples) to eliminate others.                                                 | Classic subset techniques in puzzles like Sudoku; synonymous with **set constraints** in CSP.      |
| **ECP (Elementary Constraint Propagation)** | Core propagation step that removes candidates conflicting with asserted c-values or constraints.                                                     | Equivalent to standard **constraint propagation** in CSP algorithms.                               |
| **T\&E (Trial and Error)**                  | Strategy where a candidate is tentatively asserted, consequences are explored, and contradictions backtrack.                                         | Known as **backtracking** or **guess and check** in CSP literature.                                |
