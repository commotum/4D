**A Framework for Putting Mental Models to Practice** is a series of posts that examines the notion of putting ' [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/?ref=commoncog.com) ' to practice in one's life, in the pursuit of learning better decision making.

The ideas presented in this series are a guided tour of rationality research, decision science, applied psychology and classical epistemology. My primary goal when developing this framework was to create a conceptual structure for the *personal* pursuit of improving decision making and judgment in pursuit of my goals.

It was originally written and published in [Farnam Street's Learning Community](https://fs.blog/membership/?ref=commoncog.com), and exists as a constructive alternative to the criticisms I levelled in [The Mental Model Fallacy](https://commoncog.com/the-mental-model-fallacy/).

If you do not have the time nor the inclination to read the entire series, a short summary post is available at [The Mental Model FAQ](https://commoncog.com/the-mental-model-faq/).
