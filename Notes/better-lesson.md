**The Better Lesson: Intelligence as Free‑Energy Efficiency Beyond Sutton’s Bitter Lesson**

**Intro / Abstract**

Sutton’s “Bitter Lesson” crystallized seventy years of AI history into a powerful maxim: methods that scale with computation ultimately outperform systems built on handcrafted human knowledge.  That message helped overturn a field once dominated by expert systems, but it has since swung the pendulum so far that structured expertise is often dismissed as naïve. In this paper we propose a “better lesson” that preserves Sutton’s core historical insight while correcting its overreach. Building on Sutton’s goal‑centric definition of intelligence and Chollet’s view of intelligence as skill‑acquisition efficiency,  we redefine intelligence as a system’s ability to *do more with less*—formally, its capacity to accumulate and redeploy free energy. On this view, the mastery of fire is an early intelligence amplifier: external heat partially offloaded human digestion, enabling greater caloric intake for less metabolic cost and freeing energy for other activities. We introduce *compute conductance* (a system’s ability to convert additional computation into marginal capability) and *data conductance* (its ability to absorb heterogeneous knowledge from many domains) as operational measures of this efficiency. Re‑examining contemporary systems such as ChatGPT through this lens, we show that their success cannot be explained by computation alone: they are high‑conductance hybrids that fuse scalable architectures with vast reservoirs of human expertise, contradicting the strong form of Sutton’s claim that “the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation.”  The better lesson is that the most intelligent systems are those that simultaneously maximize compute and data conductance to grow their free‑energy surplus.
