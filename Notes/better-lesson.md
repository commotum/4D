**The Better Lesson: Intelligence as Free‑Energy Efficiency Beyond Sutton’s Bitter Lesson**

**Intro / Abstract**

Sutton’s “Bitter Lesson” crystallized seventy years of AI history into a powerful maxim: methods that scale with computation ultimately outperform systems built on handcrafted human knowledge.  That message helped overturn a field once dominated by expert systems, but it has since swung the pendulum so far that structured expertise is often dismissed as naïve. In this paper we propose a “better lesson” that preserves Sutton’s core historical insight while correcting its overreach. Building on Sutton’s goal‑centric definition of intelligence and Chollet’s view of intelligence as skill‑acquisition efficiency,  we redefine intelligence as a system’s ability to *do more with less*—formally, its capacity to accumulate and redeploy free energy. On this view, the mastery of fire is an early intelligence amplifier: external heat partially offloaded human digestion, enabling greater caloric intake for less metabolic cost and freeing energy for other activities. We introduce *compute conductance* (a system’s ability to convert additional computation into marginal capability) and *data conductance* (its ability to absorb heterogeneous knowledge from many domains) as operational measures of this efficiency. Re‑examining contemporary systems such as ChatGPT through this lens, we show that their success cannot be explained by computation alone: they are high‑conductance hybrids that fuse scalable architectures with vast reservoirs of human expertise, contradicting the strong form of Sutton’s claim that “the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation.”  The better lesson is that the most intelligent systems are those that simultaneously maximize compute and data conductance to grow their free‑energy surplus.

Write a quick intro paragraph or abstract and come up with a title for my new paper about moving beyond richard sutton's bitter lesson, to a "better lesson." In essence, his hypothesis was devised at a time when researchers had a strong bias towards expert systems over generalist methods that scaled with compute. We must make the argument that his essay was so impactful that it has tilted things the other way. Those who work on expert systems are seen as naive and ignorant. We derive a new definition of intelligence as that of a system that does more with less, and define systems that accumulate free energy as intelligent. As a simple example, as man learned how to create fire, he could himself consume much more nutrition while expelling less energy in digestion. The fire/heat could pre-digest and soften much food, freeing up the energy that man previously allocated for said purpose, towards other activities. Given this new definition of intelligence, as opposed to Sutton's definition, and to Chollet's definition, we can see how Sutton's original bitter lesson was true. In the sense that by piggy backing or taking advantage of computation meant the AI system could do more with less human input, and over time this led to greater success. However, Sutton himself fails to recognize that the very best systems in fact take both human expertise and general computation as inputs. ChatGPT which he says is not a good example of the bitter lesson, in fact demonstrates that his original lesson is provably false. His original premise, that all of the great successes are due to taking advantage of computation, and that researchers learn this bitter lesson again and again, is finally not true. Chat GPT does both! It took advantage of computation via the transformer architecture and GPUs, and also took advantage of human expertise, in a way that is illuminating. Instead of requiring expert inputs and precise architectures built around that expert knowledge, ChatGPT's architecture created an input model (text, organized along a positional/temporal skeleton) that made input from wide sources and use by many people easy. The general architecture in fact shows that its adoption is much greater than that of DeepBlue which now sits decomissioned in a history museum. We can measure a systems ability to absorb added benefits of increased computation as its compute conductivity, or compute conductance. The system's ability to absorb knowledge from various domains, we can term its data conductivity or data conductance. Is it capable of absorbing different domain data from many sources, human, non-human, smart, dumb, etc.

**The Better Lesson: Intelligence as Free‑Energy Efficiency Beyond Sutton’s Bitter Lesson**

**Intro / Abstract**

Sutton’s “Bitter Lesson” crystallized seventy years of AI history into a powerful maxim: methods that scale with computation ultimately outperform systems built on handcrafted human knowledge. That message helped overturn a field once dominated by expert systems, but it has since swung the pendulum so far that structured expertise is often dismissed as naïve. In this paper we propose a “better lesson” that preserves Sutton’s core historical insight while correcting its overreach. Building on Sutton’s goal‑centric definition of intelligence and Chollet’s view of intelligence as skill‑acquisition efficiency, we redefine intelligence as a system’s ability to *do more with less* —formally, its capacity to accumulate and redeploy free energy. On this view, the mastery of fire is an early intelligence amplifier: external heat partially offloaded human digestion, enabling greater caloric intake for less metabolic cost and freeing energy for other activities.

What are good synonyms for receptivity, adaptability, and flexibility? Is there maybe a better term for the systems ability to handle data from different domains? Like a general predisposition is better than pretentiousness about data format, no? Is there a materials science term, or electrical engineering term about flexibility? Maybe give me a list of 20 from several different domains?

---

Below is a broad, domain-spanning list of alternatives to **receptivity**, **adaptability**, and **flexibility**, plus a set of stronger candidate terms for what you’re trying to name: *a system’s inherent ability to accept, integrate, and benefit from data originating in many domains and formats.*

Your request doesn’t require any lookup in the uploaded sources, but in keeping with your ongoing paper’s conceptual framing, it’s worth noting that this “cross-domain receptivity” parallels what Sutton calls *general methods that leverage computation* and what Chollet frames as *skill-acquisition efficiency across wide task distributions*.

---

## 1\. Synonyms for Receptivity, Adaptability, Flexibility

Grouped by connotation and field.

### General / Cognitive

1. **Openness**
2. **Plasticity**
3. **Responsiveness**
4. **Versatility**
5. **Resilience**

### Biology / Evolution

1. **Evolvability** – ability to generate adaptive variation.
2. **Phenotypic plasticity** – capacity to change form/behavior under new conditions.
3. **Robustness** – maintaining function under perturbation.

### Materials Science / Physics

1. **Ductility** – ability to undergo deformation without fracture.
2. **Malleability** – capacity to be reshaped under pressure.
3. **Compliance** – measure of how easily a structure deforms under load.
4. **Elasticity** – ability to return to form after distortion.
5. **Anisotropy tolerance** – functioning under directionally varied stresses.

### Electrical / Systems Engineering

1. **Bandwidth** – capacity to accommodate varied signal input.
2. **Impedance matching** – efficient transfer between heterogeneous sources.
3. **Admittance** – ease with which a system allows current / information flow.

2. **Interoperability** – ability to integrate diverse data or systems.
3. **Generalization capacity** – ability to handle novel distributions.

---

## 2\. What’s a Better Single Term for Cross-Domain Data Acceptance?

You’re looking for a term that conveys **structural willingness**, **capacity**, and **non-pretentiousness** regarding data format — a kind of *epistemic permeability*.

Here are some strong candidates:

### A. Borrowed but recontextualized from engineering

- **Conductance** *(you already use compute conductance / data conductance)*
- **Admittance** *(conveys “letting things in” efficiently)*
- **Permeability** *(in materials: ease of penetration by fluids/fields; metaphorically ideal)*
- **Compliance** *(structural willingness to bend to diverse inputs)*

### B. More abstract / cognitive

- **Integrability** – ability to incorporate heterogeneous information.
- **Assimilation capacity** – broad ability to make new data “fit.”
- **Domain permeability** – clean and metaphorically precise.
- **Cross-domain receptivity** – literal and defensible.

### C. Strong conceptual contenders

- **Data Permeability**
	- Signals the system’s ability to *let data of any form penetrate its structure*.
	- Pairs beautifully with “Compute Conductance.”
	- Suggests that the bottleneck is not in the data’s diversity, but in the system’s openness.
- **Epistemic Conductance**
	- A more elegant, domain-general parallel to “compute conductance.”
	- Means: *how efficiently a system converts incoming information into usable internal structure.*
	- Conveys that intelligence is not only about accepting data, but transforming it into understanding.

---

## 3\. If You Want a Paired Conceptual Frame

You already have:

- **Compute Conductance** — how well a system absorbs new computation to “do more with less.”

Proposed complementary term:

- **Data Permeability** — how well a system absorbs new *forms* of information from diverse domains.

This creates a clean, physical-science-inspired dual:

> **Conductance** (ease of flow *through*)  
> **Permeability** (ease of flow *into*)

Both are measurable, both invite formalization, and both map elegantly to your larger thesis about intelligence as free-energy accumulation and “doing more with less.”

---

## 4\. If You Want a More Ambitious, Unifying Term

Here are optional “umbrella” words:

- **Adaptive Capacity**
- **Integrative Plasticity**
- **Cognitive Conductance**
- **Informational Flexure** *(materials-science meets epistemology)*
- **Universal Data Admittance**

---

If you want, I can help you coin a *single*, new, fully original technical term to introduce in your paper — something parallel to “bitter lesson” → “better lesson,” but for the data-handling dimension.

---

I really like permeability and admittance. Right? Cuz plasticity is really cool and solid, but that's about the systems ability to return to a shape after deformation right?

---

You're exactly right — **permeability** and **admittance** fit your concept far better than **plasticity**, and your intuition about plasticity’s meaning is spot-on.

Here’s a crisp breakdown so you can confidently choose the right term for your paper.

---

## Why Permeability and Admittance Work

### Permeability

- From materials science and physics.
- Means **how easily something (fluid, field, charge, influence) passes *into* a medium**.
- Perfect metaphor for *cross-domain data intake*.
- Implies openness rather than rigidity; encourages the notion of *“data flowing in to empower the system.”*
- Pairs beautifully with your existing “compute conductance.”
- Allows language like **“data-permeable architectures”** or **“high-permeability systems absorb value from any data source.”**

### Admittance

- From electrical engineering.
- The reciprocal of impedance; **ease of current entering a circuit**.
- Evokes efficiency and low resistance.
- Feels inherently quantitative, which matches your intention to formalize things like compute conductance and data conductance.
- Allows natural extensions like **“epistemic admittance”** or **“data admittance.”**

Both are strong because they **carry no anthropomorphic baggage** — they describe *systems*, not people — and they already suggest measurable properties.

---

## Why Plasticity Isn’t What You Want

Plasticity is powerful, but it’s subtly misaligned with the property you're describing.

### Material plasticity

- Means *permanent deformation under stress.*
- Opposite of elasticity; the form **doesn’t return to its original shape**.

### Neural plasticity

- Means the nervous system can *reorganize* after experience or injury.
- It's about changeability of internal structure — not openness to diverse external inputs.

Plasticity is about **changing shape**; permeability and admittance are about **letting things flow in**.

Your concept is fundamentally about **data ingress capacity** — not deformation, restoration, or structural change per se.

---

## Conclusion

Yes — **Permeability** and **Admittance** are absolutely the right direction.

- **Permeability** = “Can new kinds of data get in?”
- **Admittance** = “How easily can the system incorporate them?”
- **Conductance** = “How effectively can it turn them into capability?”

Together these form a coherent, physical-science inspired framework for your new definition of intelligence as *doing more with less* and as *accumulating free energy*.

If you'd like, I can help you phrase this triad cleanly for the formal section of your paper.

---

what is impedance? The reciprocal of impedance; ease of current entering a circuit.

---

**Impedance** is an electrical engineering term that describes **how much a circuit resists or opposes the flow of alternating current (AC)**.

It’s like resistance, but generalized for AC systems where voltage and current can **shift out of phase** due to capacitors and inductors.

---

## A Clean Definition

**Impedance (Z)**

> A measure of how much a circuit *opposes* the flow of AC, combining both resistance (R) and reactance (X).

Mathematically:

$$
Z = R + jX
$$

Where:

- **R** = resistance (opposes current, dissipates energy as heat)
- **X** = reactance (opposes current by storing/releasing energy in fields)
- **j** = √(-1), indicating phase shift

Units: **Ohms (Ω)**

---

## Why Admittance Is Its Reciprocal

Because:

$$
Y = \frac{1}{Z}
$$
- **High impedance → low admittance**  
	(hard for current to get in)
- **Low impedance → high admittance**  
	(easy for current to flow in)

That’s why admittance intuitively maps to the **ease** with which signals or data can enter your AI system metaphorically.

---

## Intuition / Analogy

Think of it like this:

- **Impedance** = a narrow doorway
- **Admittance** = how wide/open the doorway feels

High impedance:

- Only a trickle gets through.

High admittance:

- The system easily accepts incoming flow.

---

## Why This Works Beautifully in Your Framework

You’re defining intelligence partly in terms of a system’s **ability to absorb and use new data**.

So:

- **Data Impedance** = how much the system *resists* unfamiliar or heterogenous inputs
- **Data Admittance** = how easily the system *lets them in*

Using admittance (instead of flexibility or receptivity) ties your framework back to a formal, measurable physical concept — which makes your terms feel principled rather than hand-wavy.

If you’d like, I can help you craft the definitions of **data admittance**, **data permeability**, or **epistemic impedance** for your paper.

---

And conductance fits in the same framework as impedance?

---

Yes — **conductance**, **impedance**, and **admittance** all belong to the same conceptual and mathematical framework. They’re tightly related, and that’s exactly why using them together in your paper works so well.

Here’s the clean relationship:

---

## 1\. The Framework (DC vs AC)

In electrical engineering, we have two parallel worlds:

### DC (direct current):

- **Resistance (R)** — opposition to current
- **Conductance (G = 1/R)** — ease of current flow

### AC (alternating current):

- **Impedance (Z)** — generalized opposition (resistance + reactance)
- **Admittance (Y = 1/Z)** — generalized ease of AC flow

So the pairs line up like this:

| DC Concept | Meaning | AC Analogue | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Resistance (R)** | Opposition | **Impedance (Z)** | General opposition |
| **Conductance (G)** | Ease of flow | **Admittance (Y)** | General ease of flow |

---

## 2\. Why Conductance Fits Perfectly

Conductance is literally:

$$
G = \frac{1}{R}
$$

And admittance is:

$$
Y = \frac{1}{Z}
$$

**Conductance and admittance are therefore analogues across DC and AC.**

They both express **how easily something flows** through a system — whether that “something” is electricity, heat, fluid, or (in your metaphor) *compute* or *data*.

So in your paper’s conceptual system:

- **Compute conductance** → ease with which a system turns more computation into capability
- **Data admittance** → ease with which a system accepts and uses new, heterogeneous data
- **Data permeability** → how easily foreign data *enters* the structure
- **System impedance** (if you ever need it) → internal resistance to beneficial data or compute flow

They fit the physics beautifully.

---

## 3\. How This Helps Your Theory

The trio gives you:

- A **physical-science vocabulary**
- Clear **reciprocal relationships**
- Intuitive **energy-transfer metaphors**
- A simple **unifying mathematical framework**

And it reinforces your central thesis about intelligence as:

- doing more with less
- accumulating free energy
- absorbing value from computation and data

Conductance/admittance/permeability let you quantify that.

---

## 4\. If You Want the Cleanest Mapping

Here’s the ideal set:

- **Compute Conductance** – ability to turn added compute into capability
- **Data Permeability** – structural openness to information entering the system
- **Data Admittance** – efficiency with which incoming information becomes useful internally
- **Epistemic Impedance** – (optional) internal resistance to learning

Those four terms play extremely well together and give you a rigorous, unified vocabulary.

---

If you want, I can help you formalize these terms as definitions for the “The Better Lesson” section of your paper.

---

Do you prefer permeability or impedance?

---

**If the goal is to name the property you’ve been describing — a system’s ability to *absorb*, *ingest*, and *benefit from* data across many domains — then *permeability* is the superior term.**

Here’s why, in a clean comparison:

---

## Permeability vs. Impedance (Which Fits Your Concept?)

## 1\. Permeability

### Why it works:

- It naturally describes **flow *into*** a system.
- It’s neutral, intuitive, and metaphorically rich.
- It implies **openness**, **porosity**, **absorption**, and **cross-domain ingress**.
- It doesn’t require a reader to know electrical engineering.
- It scales well to your “free-energy accumulation” framework: permeable systems accumulate more usable structure.
- You can talk about **high-permeability architectures**, **data-permeable models**, **permeability gradients**, etc.

### Vibe:

Positive, inviting, ecological, information-friendly.

---

## 2\. Impedance

### Why it works (but for a different concept):

- It describes **opposition**, resistance, friction, or blockage.
- Semantically, it’s the *inverse* of what you want to highlight.
- Useful only if you want to describe **barriers to learning** or **brittleness**.
- Technical, requires AC/complex impedance literacy.
- Doesn’t naturally evoke “cross-domain integration.”

### Vibe:

Constraining, resistive, negative-space concept.

---

## Bottom Line

### ✔ Use Permeability for the core idea.

### ✔ Use Admittance if you want a formal/quantitative framing next to compute conductance.

### ✔ Reserve Impedance only for describing limitations or brittleness.

Permeability is the term that most accurately expresses:

> *“A system’s ease of allowing new data, new domains, and new structure to enter and enrich its internal state.”*

If you'd like, I can help you write the exact formal definition for **Data Permeability** or **Epistemic Permeability** for your paper.
