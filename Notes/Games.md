Subtest & what it asks you to do
Typical time-savers
1
Keyholes / Apertures – Decide which oddly-shaped “keyhole” an unfamiliar 3-D object will fit through without turning.
Picture the widest dimension first; mentally “drop” the object straight in. (eruditionprep.com)
2
Top-Front-End (TFE) / Orthographic Projection – Given two views of an object, pick its missing third view.
Trace corners that “line up” across views to avoid mis-counting hidden edges. (dat-prep.com)
3
Angle Ranking – Rank four closely spaced angles from smallest to largest.
Compare just the apex region; draw an imaginary arc to judge curvature. (bootcamp.com)
4
Hole-Punching (Paper Folding) – A square sheet is folded up to 3× and hole-punched; you choose the final unfolded pattern.
Work backwards: mirror the punch with every unfold, one fold at a time. (shemmassianconsulting.com)
5
Cube Counting – A block of cubes is painted on some faces, then broken apart. Count cubes with 0, 1, 2, or 3 painted faces.
Make a quick 3-column tally as you scan; memorize corner/edge/face counts. (bootcamp.com)
6
Pattern (3-D) Folding / Spatial Relations – Choose which 3-D solid results when a complex 2-D net is folded into a box-like shape.
Identify an “anchor” face, then see where a distinctive edge or dot must land. (shemmassianconsulting.com)
