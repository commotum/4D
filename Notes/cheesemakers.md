- The sign of position ( $x$ or $y$ ) tells us where an object is.
- The sign of velocity ( $v_x$ or $v_y$ ) tells us which direction the object is moving.
- The sign of acceleration ( $a_x$ or $a_y$ ) tells us which way the acceleration vector points, not whether the object is speeding up or slowing down.


1.7.1 Using Symbols

Symbols are a language that allows us to talk with precision about the relationships in a problem. As with any language, we all need to agree to use words or symbols in the same way if we want to communicate with each other. Many of the ways we use symbols in science and engineering are somewhat arbitrary, often reflecting historical roots. Nonetheless, practicing scientists and engineers have come to agree on how to use the language of symbols. Learning this language is part of learning physics.
