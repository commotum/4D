# **Vocabulary**

## **Face Moves (18 standard 3×3 turns):**

**R, L, U, D, F, B** — Right, Left, Up, Down, Front, Back face turns (90° clockwise).
**R’, L’, U’, D’, F’, B’** — Same faces turned 90° counter-clockwise.
**R2, L2, U2, D2, F2, B2** — Same faces turned 180° (only one 180° direction matters; CW/CCW are identical).
*(No 270° moves — a 270° rotation is simply the opposite 90°, e.g., R’.)*

## **Cube Rotations (9 whole-cube turns):**

**x, y, z** — Rotate the entire cube like R, U, or F respectively (90° clockwise).
**x’, y’, z’** — Same cube rotations, 90° counter-clockwise.
**x2, y2, z2** — Same cube rotations, 180°.

## **Colors (6 standard Rubik’s Cube face colors):**

**White, Yellow, Red, Orange, Green, Blue** — The six colors used on a standard Rubik’s Cube (each color corresponds to one fixed center face).

## **Pieces / Cubies (26 total pieces + 1 core):**

**6 center pieces** — One on each face; one color each; fixed in place.
**8 corner pieces** — Three colors each; located at cube corners.
**12 edge pieces** — Two colors each; located between corners along edges.
**1 internal core** — Not visible; holds the cube together and determines center orientation.
