## KEY TO THE CONVENTIONS OF THE DICTIONARY

#### Abbreviations

For a list of abbreviations used in the Dictionary, see p. lxvi.
Abbreviations may be entered in the Dictionary either as *main words*:

> **ABTA, Abta** ('æbtə). [Acronym f. the initial letters of the association.] The Association of British Travel Agents, established in 1950.
> **1950** *Travel Topics* Nov. 64/1 We can even hope that one day..membership of the A.B.T.A. will be accepted as sufficient evidence by the operating companies. **1963** *Times* 11 Jan. 6/5 The council of the Abta (the Association of British Travel Agents) in effect warned its members not to sell the scheme to the public, on the grounds that it contravened the association’s code of conduct. **1981** *Economist* 24 Jan. 78/3 Competing operators argue that the customer gets less protection, since Travel Bazaar’s four shops do not belong to the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta). **1984** *Daily Tel.* 12 Mar. 3/3 ABTA..is asking members to point out the dangers to tourists.

or in the final section of the entry for the corresponding *initial letter*, as at **A III**:

> **ASL**, American Sign Language; **A.S.M.**, air-to-surface missile; **A.S.M.**, assistant stage-manager; **A/S.R.S.**, Air-Sea Rescue Service; **A.S.T.M.S.** (also with pronunc. 'æstəmz), Association of Scientific, Technical, and Managerial Staffs; **A.S.V.**, air(craft) to surface vessel; **A.T.A.**, Air Transport Auxiliary;

#### Alphabetical order

The alphabetical order of the main entries in the Dictionary is strictly *letter-by-letter*, i.e. ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces between words:

> **Athoan**  
> **athodyd**  
> **at-hold**  
> **Athole brose**  
> **at home, at-home**  
> **-athon**

Note that headwords in which a final letter is *bracketed* with an opening bracket only appear where they would if the letter(s) after the bracket were not there:

> **air**  
> **air(e**  
> **airable**

whereas those with both opening and closing brackets appear where they would if the brackets were not present:  
> **amarant(h)ine**  
> **amarant(h)oid**  
> **amarantite**

Where two words are identical in spelling, they are differentiated by *part of speech*:  
> **aid** (eɪd), *v.*  
> **aid** (eɪd), *sb.*

If two words of the same part of speech have distinct etymologies, they are differentiated by *superior numbers*:

> **†aire**, *sb.*¹ *Obs.*; also 6 aare. [a. OFr. *aire*:—L. *āra* altar.] An altar.  
> **†aire**, *sb.*² *Obs*. Forms: 4 air, 5 eyre, 7 ayre, 4–7 aire. [a. OFr. *aire*: see AERIE.] The earlier equivalent of AERIE.

#### Combinations

Combinations of words, and compound words, may be entered in their normal alphabetical sequence as main words:

> **'air-ˌchamber.** [**AIR-** 7.]
> **1. a.** Any chamber or cavity filled with air in an animal or plant, *esp.* those in a ‘chambered-shell.’
> **1847** ANSTED *Anc. World* iii. 43 In the Nautilus..we find a large, powerful, and complicated shell, composed of a number of separate compartments or air-chambers. **1855** OWEN *Vertebr.* I. ii. (L.) These air-chambers between the outer table and the immediate covering of the brain.
> **b.** A chamber filled with air in a boat, airship, etc., to provide or assist buoyancy.
> **1881** W. D. HAY *300 Years Hence* vii. 133 In the upper part [of the boat] was the entrance and air-chamber. **1882** *Encycl. Brit.* XIV. 570/2 The buoyancy of the institution’s lifeboat..is secured chiefly by means of a watertight deck..and two large air-chambers, one in the bow, the other in the stern. **1908** H. G. WELLS *War in Air* viii. § 1 The airship was remarkably simple to construct: given the air-chamber material, the engines, [etc.]..it was really not more complicated..than an ordinary wooden boat had been..before.
> **2.** In a pump or other hydraulic machine, a receptacle containing air, the elasticity of which, when condensed, maintains a constant pressure upon the water; an air-vessel.
> **1873** ATKINSON *tr. Ganot’s Physics* § 206 The fire engine is a force pump in which a steady jet is obtained by the aid of an air-chamber.

> **'air-ˌchambered,** *a.* [f. prec. + -ED.] Furnished with air-chambers.
> **1856** KANE *Arct. Explor.* I. v. 49 It [boat] was air-chambered and buoyant.

If they are less complex, they are normally entered in the concluding section of the entry for the *first word*, as at AID:

> **8.** *Comb. and attrib.*, chiefly in sense 7, as **aid-band**, **-cohort**, **-force**, **-soldier**; or in sense 5, as **aid-money**: (all *obs.*). Also **aid-major** *obs.* an adjutant; **aid-post**, a post at which wounded soldiers receive first medical attention; **aid-prayer** in *Law*: see 2.

or under the *combining form* which is their first element, as at AERO-:

> **ˌaerothera'peutics** (*Syd. Soc. Lex.*, 1881), **-'therapy** = PNEUMATOTHERAPEUTICS; **ae'rotropism** *Bot.* [ad. G. *aërotropismus* (H. Molisch 1885, in *Wiener Akad. Sitzungsber.* XC. I. 137), f. Gr. *τροπή* turning (*τρέπειν* to turn): see -ISM], the property, exhibited *esp.* by the growing roots of plants, of bending or turning towards a source of air; hence **aero'tropic** *a.*

#### Cross-references

Cross-reference to another main word (or derivative) is made in small Roman capitals:

> **'air-balloon.** [**AIR-** 7.] †**1.** = **BALLOON** *sb.¹* 3. *Obs.*
> **1753** *Publ. Advertiser* 25 May, A cascade, and shower of fire, and grand air-balloons, were most magnificently displayed.

Where the entry referred to is for a proper noun, the cross-reference appears in small capitals with a full capital initial:

> || bengaline ('bɛngəli:n). [mod.F.; so called from similarity to the fabric mentioned under **BENGAL** 1.] A (French) name for poplin, a mixed fabric of silk and worsted.
> **1884** *Pall Mall G.* 20 Sept. 4/1 Autumn Fashions, Bengaline (a superior substitute for Irish poplin).

Cross-reference to a phrase or word combination in another entry is made in italic type:

> **A.C.V.**, air-cushion vehicle (see *air-cushion* (b) s.v. **AIR** *sb.¹* **B. II**); **A.C.W.**, aircraftwoman; **A.D.C.**, aide-de-camp;

Some cross-references mix italic and small capitals; in these, the word in small capitals indicates the entry in which the phrase will be found:

> || **absurdum** (æb's3:dəm). [L. neuter of *absurdus* adj., used substantively as a scholastic term in med.L.] An absurd or illogical conclusion or condition. See **REDUCTIO** *ad absurdum*.
> *a* **1834** LAMB *Spec. fr. Fuller* 537 *note*, Setting up an *absurdum* on purpose to hunt it down. **1877** KINGLAKE *Crimea* (ed. 6) I. xv. 342 Reducing the theory of Representative Government to the *absurdum*.

Cross-reference entries are entered in the same alphabetical sequence as other main words:

> **absychitical**, erroneous form of **APSYCHICAL**.  
> **ahwene**, variant of **AWHENE** *v. Obs.*, to vex.  
> **ai, aie**, obs. forms of **AY, AYE**, and of **EGG**.

#### Derivatives

Derivatives of the main word may be treated as main words in their own right, or be placed in a section at the end of the entry for the word on which they are formed, introduced by ‘Hence’, ‘Also’, or ‘So’:

> **aeronautic** (ˌeɪərəʊ'nɔ:tɪk, ˌɛərəʊ-), *a.* [f. prec. + -IC; cf. Gr. *ναυτικ-ός* pertaining to sailing.] Of or pertaining to aeronauts, or to aerial navigation; sailing the air.

In some cases, the main word and derivative(s) are treated together:

> **asynapsis** (æ-, eɪsɪ'næpsɪs). *Biol.* [f. A- *pref.* 14 + SYNAPSIS.] Absence of synapsis; failure of chromosomes to pair in meiosis. **Hence asy'naptic** *a.*

Cytol.* (ed. 2) vii. 291 In ‘asynaptic’ maize which has as a rule no pairing of chromosomes at meiosis, the progeny nevertheless show the results of normal crossing-over. **1949** DARLINGTON & MATHER *Elem. Genetics* v. 110 A so-called asynaptic gene often..produces a general reduction in the crossing-over of all the chromosome pairs when homozygous.

#### Division into senses

Large Roman capital letters are used principally for division of an entry into different parts of speech:

> **annelid(e** ('ænəlɪd), *sb. and a. Zool.* [a. mod.Fr. *annélide*, f. as next: see **-ID**.]
> **A.** *sb.* A member of the division of *Annelida*; a red-blooded worm.
> **1834** SIR C. BELL *Hand* 263 These annelides can creep and turn in every direction. **1857** WOOD *Obj. Sea-shore* 94 The commonest of the terrestrial annelids is the earth-worm.
> **B.** *adj.* Of or pertaining to the *Annelida*.
> **1855** KINGSLEY *Glaucus* (1878) 113 Long Annelid worms of quaintest forms and colours. **1865** BRISTOW *Figuier's World bef. Del.* iv, [No] indications of life, except annelide-tracks, and burrows.

Large Roman capital numerals are used to indicate the ‘branches’ or main historical divisions of the sense development: see General Explanations, p. xxix. The distinct senses of a word are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, etc.; each of these senses may be further subdivided **a**, **b**, **c**, etc., and a further subdivision (*a*), (*b*), (*c*), or (i), (ii), (iii), etc. is also possible: for further explanation, see p. xxxiii.

#### Etymology

The etymology and form history are introduced by *bold square brackets*. In the main entry, these are placed after the variant forms:

> **annates** ('æneɪts, -əts). Also 6 annatys, 6–8 annats. [a. Fr. *annate* (15th c.), ad. med. and late L. *annāta* a year’s space, work, proceeds, the same word which in its primary sense became in Fr. *année*. See **-ATA**.]

Etymologies, or etymological information, may also occur in other places within an entry, still enclosed in square brackets:

> airbrasive *a.* and *sb.* [**A)BRASIVE** *a.*] *Dentistry* (see quots.); air-break, (*a*) [**BREAK** *sb.¹* **5**] *Cricket*, a ‘twist’ or deviation in the air, of the ball when bowled; (*b*) [**BREAK** *sb.¹* **17 b**] *Electr. Engin.*, *attrib.* (see quot. 1910);

#### Labels

Labels normally appear in italic type, and are used to indicate the status or usage of a word or sense. Usage labels include indications of register (*colloq.*, *slang*), geographical area (*U.S.*, *Austral.*), or subject specialization (*Law*, *Linguistics*). For further explanation, see p. xxvii.
The *part of speech*, or grammatical category of a word, is normally given in italic type after the headword or subordinate word(s):

> **anneal** (ə'ni:l), *v.* Forms: 1 onælan (anælan), 2  
> **air-dammed** *a.*, furnished with an air dam;

Where the subordinate words are given in bold italic type, the part of speech may follow in Roman:

> **air-dried** *a.*, dried by the action of the air; so ***air-dry*** v. trans.; **air-driven** *a.*, actuated by means of compressed air;

Where no part of speech is given, the entry is for a noun (substantive).

#### Pronunciation

The pronunciation, transcribed according to the International Phonetic Alphabet, is enclosed in *round brackets*:

> **aerobic** (ɛə'rəʊbɪk), *a.* [f. **AEROBE** + -IC.]
>
> || **aide-de-camp** (ɛddəkã, 'eɪddə,kɒŋ). *Mil.*

The pronunciation normally appears immediately after the headword or subordinate word, but may be given elsewhere, for example when different senses have distinct pronunciations:

> **adjoint** ('ædʒɔɪnt), *sb.*² and *a.* [mod.Fr. *adjoint*, pa. pple. of *adjoindre* to **ADJOIN**, used as an appellative. Mod.Fr. form of prec.]
> || **A.** *sb.*² (with pronunc. **adʒwɛ̃**). Official title of a French civil officer who assists the maire; also, an assistant professor in a French college.

For a detailed description of the IPA transcription used, see pp. xxxiii–xxxiv; a key to the symbols is given on p. lxv.
In some cases, it is unnecessary to give a full phonetic transcription; instead, the word is printed with a stress mark (') before the stressed syllable:

> **aero'nautical,** *a.* [f. prec. + -AL¹.] Of or belonging to aeronautics; connected with the navigation of the air.

Secondary stress is indicated by an inferior stress mark (,):

> **'air-conˌditioning,** *vbl. sb.* [cf. **CONDITION** *v.* 9.] The process of cleaning air and controlling its temperature and humidity before it enters a room, building, etc., and in certain

#### Quotations

The quotations illustrate the use of the word in a given sense, and are normally arranged in *chronological order*, starting with the earliest available printed example of the sense:

> **aircraft** ('ɛəkrɑ:ft, -æ-). [f. **AIR-** III. + **CRAFT** *sb.* 9.] Flying-machines collectively; a flying-machine.
> Since the 1930s commonly restricted to denote an aeroplane (as distinct from a balloon or airship) or aeroplanes collectively. The nineteenth-century examples refer to balloons and airships.
> **1850** J. WISE *System of Aeronautics* xvi. 102 The aircraft has but one medium, the water-craft has two. **1876** C. B. MANSFIELD *Aerial Navig.* 2 Air-craft seems an appropriate term for the whole apparatus, including boat and gas vessel, or car and balloon. *Ibid.* 11. viii. 323 The inventors of air-crafts. **1903** *Aeronaut. Jrnl.* VII. 81/1 His world-famed aircrafts. **1909** *Daily Chron.* 26 Feb. 1/2 The vast commercial possibilities that the manufacture and world-wide use of air craft offer. **1910** ROTCH in *Epitome Aeronaut.

T. JANE *All the World’s Air-craft* III. 7/1 It has..been deemed advisable gradually to change the title of this annual to *All the World’s Air-craft*, in order to avoid

A quotation in square brackets, usually preceding the first example, indicates a use which helps to illustrate the development of the sense, while not strictly exemplifying it:

> Hence ˌaeromagne'tometer, an instrument for making aeromagnetic measurements.
> [**1946** R. BALSLEY in *Petroleum Engineer* Aug. 108/1 The obvious advantages of the air-magnetometer are its speed..and the fact that it can be used where ground methods are..unpracticable.] **1948** *World Oil* CXXVIII. 223 (heading) Aeromagnetometer profile flown from Venezuela to Texas. **1969** *New Scientist* 9 Jan. 58/2 An aeromagnetometer survey to last several months will be started shortly.

Where many combinations are treated together, the quotations illustrating each are grouped chronologically and the groups are arranged in the alphabetical order of the combinations. Asterisks are sometimes used to mark the first quotation for each combination:

> **1889** *Cent. Dict.*, *Air-blast. **1902** *Encycl. Brit.* XXXIII. 422/1 In..air-blast transformers, apertures are left in the core by means of which the cooling air can reach the interior portions. **1946** H. P. YOUNG *Electr. Power Syst. Control* (ed. 2) vii. 194 Air-blast breakers can be classified into three main types depending upon the manner in which the compressed air is directed at the arc. **1845** *North Brit. Rev.* IV. 128 An *air-bloomery..was dependent, for its blast, upon the varying currents of air that played around the hill on which it was placed. **1860** W. FORDYCE *Hist. Coal* 110 The first smelting furnace..was undoubtedly the Air-Bloomery, a low conical structure, with small openings at the bottom for the admission of air, and a larger orifice at the top for carrying off the gaseous products of combustion. **1855** OWEN *Skel. & Teeth* 7 The extremities of such *air-bones present a light, open net-work. **1872** *Rep. Comm. Patents 1871* I. 253 Westinghouse, George, Jr.,..Valve device for steam-power *air-brake couplings. **1945** R. B. BLACK in *Jrnl. Amer. Dental Assoc.* XXXII. 956/2 The *airbrasive process employs for its action a very fine—almost pinpoint—stream of compressed air into which a suitable finely divided abrasive agent has been introduced. **1953** I. GLICKMAN *Clin. Periodontology* xxxix. 665 Airbrasive which consists of fine abrasive powder (Dolomite in a stream of carbon dioxide) is used for removing surface deposits from the teeth. **1900** *Cricket* 29 Mar. 41/3 There is no necessity to mention Noble’s *air-breaks any more.

For an explanation of the typographical conventions used in quotations, see p. xxx.

#### Superior numbers

Superior numbers are used to distinguish homonyms (see alphabetical order above) and after the labels *Obs.* and *rare* to indicate words or senses for which only one (-¹) or no (-⁰) contextual example from a printed source was available to the editors.

#### Variant forms

Variant forms of a word are printed in light bold type, and are introduced by ‘Also’ or ‘Forms’:

> || **abaca** ('æbəkə). Also **abaka**. The native name of the palm (*Musa textilis*) which furnishes what is commonly known as Manilla Hemp; [etc.]
>
> **aback** (ə'bæk), *adv.* Forms: 1 **on bæc**; 2 **a bec**; 2-3 **on bak**, **o bak**; 2-5 **a bak**, **abak**; 4-8 **a-back(e**, **abacke**; 6- **aback**. [OE. *on* prep. *bæc* sb. = unto [etc.]

Numerals are used before variant forms to indicate the century during which a particular form is recorded: see p. xxvii.
