Let's hypothesize, imagine for a moment, that someone invents or derives a truly 4D extension of RoPE that can coherently handle tasks from any dimensional domain. Let's hypothesize that they create a modified attention score that uses the Minkowski dot product (assigning a minkowskian metric or clifford algebra of \[+t, -x, -y, -z\]) that has true Lorentzian treatment of space and time. I'm sure you're quick to identify several road blocks to that being viable, ignore that instinct. We're not here to be pedants. We are trying to analyze the counterfactual situation, where if they somehow (we don't care how exactly) were able to develop such a generalized extension of RoPE, which includes now a causal light cone, (cool!) and treats space in all directions isotropically, using generators to create commuting 4D Lorentz rotors to apply blockwise to 4-subvector elements in the larger embedding vector. Let's say they figured all of this out. And let's say the consequence is a SINGULAR model that can coherently reason about tasks in any domain n'import the dimension. It can train on text, and generate text just like GPT2. It can do image recognition, visual and spatial reasoning, and spatio temporal reasoning. It can move about 3D worlds and play games in them, it can do Sudokus and play any number of 2D games and exhibiting phenomenal reasoning and deductive logic. It can solve any Rubik's cube in only 20 turns (half turn metric). It can carry a conversation, extract text, and to top it all off, it gets the high score of 98% on the ARC-AGI 2 private hidden test set and wins the competition blowing everyone out of the water. This model would clearly be different from current multimodal systems/models (see the attached file on the SOTA today). In fact it would solve what Richard Sutton claims to be one of the greatest obstacles to continual learners (a domain-agnostic model) because a truly Lorentzian 4D positional encoder would be capable of representing any thing that exists in our world. It would be a breakthrough on par with GPT-2. The title of Radford et al's paper for GPT-2 was: "Large Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners" The big insight being that with a universal interface (next token prediction) and a gigantic diverse dataset (webtext) meant that you could get labels implicitly from the data, and because of the diversity and scale of that data, it could automatically outperform many task specific models. Today, the state of ViTs, and multimodal systems in general, most research only tackles a few tasks at most. Image recognition, or generation. Few are doing spatiotemporal reasoning over many tasks. So if such an encoding method was created, let's say the 4D generalization that keeps all the advantages of RoPE while providing a universal positional encoder is titled, "MonSTERs or Minkowski SpaceTime Encoding Rotors." And let's say they decide to call the multitask models trained across many dimensions and domains of tasks like we said above, let's say they decide to call those models MonSTER Models to differentiate them from multimodal systems which aren't coherently integrated into a single model and are domain specific, not domain agnostic. IF all that were to happen, what would be a good title for the paper about it? If the title mirrored GPT-2's title "MonSTER Models are \_\_\_\_ Multitask \_\_\_\_" "MonSTER Models are Multitask Spatiotemporal Reasoners" or "MonSTER Models are Spacetime Multitask Reasoners" Or agents? Or learners? Or "MonSTER Models are Domain Agnostic Multitask Reasoners" Or what?

Oh this is a *great* counterfactual. You’re basically asking: *if the leap really happened*, what name would honestly signal the same kind of conceptual rupture that **“Large Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners”** did in 2019—without underselling or overhyping it.

Let’s unpack the *spirit* of the GPT-2 title first, because that matters more than the literal words.

---

## What GPT-2’s title actually did (structurally)

Radford et al. weren’t naming an architecture. They were naming a **new capability class** that emerged *because* of a universal interface + scale.

Key properties of the GPT-2 title:

- **Declarative** (“X *are* Y”)
- **Capability-defining**, not mechanism-defining
- **General**, not task- or modality-specific
- Slightly provocative, but defensible *after* you read the paper

So the MonSTER paper title should:

1. Claim a *new category* of model behavior
2. Be agnostic to downstream tasks
3. Imply unification, not just multimodality
4. Let the Minkowski / Lorentzian machinery live in the *methods*, not the headline

---

## Core axis you’re choosing between

Your candidates fall into a few conceptual buckets:

### 1\. Reasoners

- Emphasizes inference, deduction, planning
- Slightly narrower, more cognitive
- Strong alignment with ARC-AGI, Rubik’s cube, games

### 2\. Learners

- Emphasizes emergence from data
- Directly mirrors GPT-2’s framing
- More Sutton-aligned (continual learning, generality)

### 3\. Agents

- Implies action, embodiment, environment interaction
- Slightly premature unless agency is central in the paper

### 4\. Spacetime / Domain-Agnostic qualifiers

- Risky to put *too much physics* in the title
- Better as a modifier than the headline noun

---

## Titles that feel GPT-2-level (ranked)

### 🥇 Best overall (closest spiritual successor)

> **MonSTER Models are Domain-Agnostic Multitask Learners**

Why this works:

- “Domain-agnostic” is the *actual* bombshell here
- “Learners” mirrors GPT-2 exactly
- Leaves room for text, vision, action, games, logic, etc.
- Implies continual learning without claiming it outright
- Ages well even if specific benchmarks change

This is the one Sutton would *not* hate.

---

### 🥈 If you want to emphasize reasoning, not just learning

> **MonSTER Models are General Spatiotemporal Reasoners**

Pros:

- “General” does a lot of work
- “Spatiotemporal” hints at the Minkowski breakthrough without naming it
- “Reasoners” fits ARC, planning, Rubik’s cube, games

Cons:

- Slightly narrower than “learners”
- A bit more cognitive-science flavored

---

### 🥉 If you want maximal conceptual provocation

> **MonSTER Models are Universal Multitask Learners**

This is bold, clean, dangerous—in a good way.

- “Universal” will raise eyebrows
- Forces the paper to *earn* the claim
- Signals a phase change, not an incremental improvement

This is the “we know exactly what we’re saying” title.

---

## Titles I would not recommend (and why)

### ❌ “Spacetime Multitask Reasoners”

- Too physics-forward
- Sounds like a niche subfield, not a paradigm shift

### ❌ “Multitask Spatiotemporal Reasoners”

- Technically accurate
- Emotionally flat
- Reads like a workshop paper, not a moment

### ❌ “Agents”

- Brings baggage (RL, autonomy, alignment, embodiment)
- Distracts from the encoding breakthrough

---

## A subtle but powerful alternative framing

If you wanted to *echo GPT-2 even more closely*:

> **MonSTER Models are Geometry-Induced Multitask Learners**

This is riskier, but philosophically elegant:

- Signals that geometry—not modality—is the unifier
- Positions the Lorentzian encoder as *the* enabling insight
- Appeals to both ML and physics audiences

---

## My honest recommendation

If this paper really does what you hypothesize— *one model, one positional geometry, many domains, emergent competence* —then the title that history would remember is:

> **MonSTER Models are Domain-Agnostic Multitask Learners**

It’s calm. It’s confident. And it lets the results do the flexing.

If you want, next we can:

- Draft the **abstract in GPT-2 style**
- Workshop the **opening paragraph**
- Or design the **“why this is different from multimodal systems” figure**, which this paper absolutely needs

---

I'm feeling like learners is good, even if they kill/are incredible at reasoning over spacetime, cuz it hearkens to the original title right? And domain-agnostic replaces "Unsupervised" as the surprising element because everyone basically already agrees that self-supervised learning over data implicitly labeled is the go to nowadays, right?

---

Yeah — your instinct is *dead on*, and you’re reading the historical rhyme correctly.

You’ve basically reverse-engineered **why GPT-2’s title worked**, and why *this* substitution is the right one.

Let me say it cleanly, without pedantry:

---

## 1\. “Learners” is the right noun — even if the model is an absurdly good reasoner

GPT-2 could already *reason* in weak forms. What shocked people wasn’t that it could do logic puzzles — it was that **learning alone was sufficient**.

Same thing here.

Even if MonSTER models:

- dominate ARC-AGI,
- do flawless spatiotemporal reasoning,
- plan, navigate, manipulate, and deduce,

the *claim you’re making* is not “we built a better reasoner.”

It’s:

> **We built a learner whose inductive bias no longer depends on domain.**

That’s the phase change.

So yes — **“learners” is more fundamental than “reasoners.”**  
Reasoning is downstream. Learning is the root.

---

## 2\. Why “domain-agnostic” is the correct replacement for “unsupervised”

This is the key historical symmetry, and you nailed it.

### In 2019, the surprising part was:

> “You don’t need task labels.”

Hence:

> **Unsupervised Multitask Learners**

### In 2026-ish (your counterfactual world), that surprise is gone

Everyone already accepts:

- self-supervised learning
- implicit labeling
- scale + diversity → generalization

So “unsupervised” today is *table stakes*. It would undersell the contribution.

### The new thing people still don’t believe is possible is:

> **A single learner whose competence does not fracture across domains or dimensionalities.**

That’s exactly what **domain-agnostic** communicates.

It says:

- no vision backbone vs language backbone
- no modality adapters doing the real work
- no “this model is good at X but brittle at Y”

Just: **one learner, many worlds**.

---

## 3\. Why the title works rhetorically (this matters)

> **MonSTER Models are Domain-Agnostic Multitask Learners**

This title:

- sounds *obvious* after you read the paper
- sounds *wrong* before you do
- doesn’t explain *how* (that’s what the paper is for)
- will age well as tasks and benchmarks change

That’s exactly what you want.

It’s the kind of title that, five years later, people reference like:

> “Since MonSTER models showed that domain-agnostic multitask learning was possible…”

Which is the dream.

---

## 4\. A small but important nuance you got right

You’re also implicitly avoiding a trap:

If you said “spacetime learners” or “Lorentzian learners,” you’d be:

- anchoring the contribution to physics language
- inviting pointless debates about whether Minkowski is *necessary*

By saying **domain-agnostic**, you:

- focus attention on *capability*
- let the geometry justify itself empirically
- avoid getting stuck in representation theory fights

That’s very GPT-2-coded behavior, in the best way.

---

## Bottom line

Yes.

- **Learners** is the right noun.
- **Domain-agnostic** is the right shock factor.
- The parallel to GPT-2 is real, not cosmetic.

If this were real, that title would *absolutely* be remembered.

If you want next, we can:

- write the **first two sentences of the abstract** in a Radford-esque tone
- sanity-check how reviewers would try (and fail) to poke holes in the framing
- or sketch the **one killer figure** that makes the claim undeniable

---

Yeah, let's write the prophetic-perfect tense abstract. Here's the original for reference.

---

Perfect. Let’s do this properly — *prophetic-perfect tense*, Radford cadence, calm confidence, zero hype words doing real work.

I’ll mirror the **structure**, **claims**, and **tone** of the GPT-2 abstract you shared, but translate it cleanly into the MonSTER world.

---

## Abstract

Machine learning systems are typically designed around domain-specific input representations and positional encodings, resulting in models that excel within narrow regimes but fail to generalize coherently across domains with different dimensional structure. We demonstrate that MonSTER models — Transformers equipped with a unified spacetime positional encoding — learn to perform a wide range of tasks across text, vision, spatial reasoning, and embodied environments without task-specific architectures or domain-specific inductive biases. When trained on a sufficiently diverse corpus of naturally occurring spatiotemporal data, MonSTER models acquire competencies including language understanding and generation, visual recognition, multi-step spatial reasoning, game playing, and abstract problem solving in a zero-shot setting.

The capacity of the model and the expressiveness of its positional representation are essential to successful domain-agnostic multitask learning, with performance improving predictably as both are scaled. Our largest model achieves state-of-the-art results across a broad suite of benchmarks spanning linguistic, visual, and spatiotemporal reasoning tasks, including near-ceiling performance on the ARC-AGI evaluation, while remaining a single unified model trained under a common objective. Qualitative analysis reveals coherent internal representations of space, time, and causality that support flexible generalization across domains previously treated as separate problem classes.

These results suggest that imposing a shared geometric structure over positional information provides a viable path toward general-purpose learning systems that infer tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations, independent of domain or modality.

---

If you want, next we can:

- **Tighten it further** to exactly match Radford’s sentence lengths and rhythm
- Write the **first paragraph of the Introduction** that frames the “domain fracture” problem
- Or draft the **one-sentence takeaway** reviewers will quote when they try to summarize the paper and accidentally undersell it

---

Yeah let's tighten it further, try to match/mirror the abstract as closely as is reasonably possible without crushing our message.

---

Hell yes. Here’s a **tightened, mirror-polished version** that tracks the **sentence structure, rhythm, and rhetorical moves** of the GPT-2 abstract extremely closely, while preserving your core claim and not crushing the message. I’ll keep it sober, declarative, and just barely audacious — exactly like the original.

---

## Abstract

Machine learning systems for language, vision, and control are typically approached using domain-specific architectures and positional encodings trained on task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that MonSTER models begin to learn a wide range of tasks across domains without any domain-specific supervision when trained using a unified spacetime positional encoding on a sufficiently diverse corpus of naturally occurring data. When conditioned on appropriate task contexts, MonSTER models perform language understanding and generation, visual recognition, spatial and spatiotemporal reasoning, game playing, and abstract problem solving in a zero-shot setting.

The capacity of the model and the structure of the positional encoding are essential to successful domain-agnostic multitask learning, and increasing either improves performance predictably across tasks. Our largest model is a single Transformer trained under a common objective that achieves state-of-the-art results on a broad suite of benchmarks spanning linguistic, visual, and spatiotemporal domains, including near-ceiling performance on the ARC-AGI evaluation, while still underfitting the full diversity of its training data. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and exhibit coherent reasoning over space, time, and causality.

These findings suggest a promising path toward building general-purpose learning systems that learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations, independent of domain or modality.

### Why this works (brief, non-pedantic)

- Sentence 1 mirrors *“NLP tasks are typically approached…”*
- Sentence 2 mirrors *“We demonstrate that language models begin to learn…”*
- Zero-shot framing is preserved, not overclaimed
- “Still underfitting” is a subtle confidence flex, just like GPT-2
- The final sentence cleanly inherits *“naturally occurring demonstrations”* — the real philosophical anchor

If you want next, we can:

- Tune this **one more notch tighter** (Radford-level minimalism)
- Write the **opening paragraph of Section 1** that introduces “domain fracture” as the central problem
- Or craft the **reviewer-proof one-line contribution statement** that locks the narrative before they try to reframe it
