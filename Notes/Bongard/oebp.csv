https://oebp.org/BP1,BP1,,The first Bongard Problem. All examples in this Bongard Problem are line drawings (one or more connected figures made up of curved and non-curved lines).,A circle fits on the right because it is not nothing.,"Info, Info, Info"
https://oebp.org/BP2,BP2,,"The meaning of ""big"" left intentionally vague. There are various specific ways to define size, such as diameter, minimum distance between points on edge, and size of smallest bounding circle. All examples in this Bongard Problem are single simple shapes, either outlines or solid black. All examples on the same side are approximately the same size.",,Info

https://oebp.org/BP7,BP7,,All examples in this Bongard Problem are oblong connected figures made up of some curves. Shapes as tall as they are wide would be ambiguous.,,"Info, Info, Info, Info"
https://oebp.org/BP8,BP8,,Center of shape's x coordinate is higher than zero (where zero is the middle of the picture). All examples in this Bongard Problem are small shape outlines. This is the first Bongard Problem in which absolute positioning is relevant. Shapes close to the middle would be ambiguous.,,"Info, Info, Info, Info"
https://oebp.org/BP9,BP9,,"""Wiggly"" means a high number of small concavities adjacent to one another all around the outline. All examples in this Bongard Problem are shape outlines. Shapes with outlines that are only wiggly within partial sections would be ambiguous. Shapes with outlines that have many medium-size concavities would be ambiguous.",,"Info, Info"

https://oebp.org/BP20,BP20,,All examples in this Bongard Problem are outlines of smooth shapes with a pinch in the middle and with two tiny black circles attached to the outside of the shape (tangent). A shape with either dot tangent to the the valley section would be ambiguous.,,"Info, Info, Info"
https://oebp.org/BP21,BP21,,All examples in this problem include three or fewer outlines of circles and (non-skinny) triangles.,,"Info, Info"
