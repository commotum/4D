https://oebp.org/BP1,BP1,,The first Bongard Problem. All examples in this Bongard Problem are line drawings (one or more connected figures made up of curved and non-curved lines).,A circle fits on the right because it is not nothing.,"Info, Info, Info"
https://oebp.org/BP2,BP2,,"The meaning of ""big"" left intentionally vague. There are various specific ways to define size, such as diameter, minimum distance between points on edge, and size of smallest bounding circle. All examples in this Bongard Problem are single simple shapes, either outlines or solid black. All examples on the same side are approximately the same size.",,Info

This can be interpreted symbolically as foreshadowing that computers will be able to perform the various tasks that humans can do. Another idea introduced by this Bongard Problem is that a Bongard Problem can teach its solution to the solver. (See keyword teach.)
