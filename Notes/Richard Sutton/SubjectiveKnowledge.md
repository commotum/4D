      <h1>Subjective Knowledge</h1>
      <h2>Rich Sutton</h2>
      <h3>April 6, 2001</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to revive an old idea about the mind. This is the
        idea
        that
        the mind arises from, and is principally about, our
        sensori-motor
        interaction with the world. It is the idea that all our sense of
        the
        world,
        of space, objects, and other people, arises from our experience
        squeezed
        through the narrow channel of our sensation and action. This is
        a
        radical
        view, but in many ways an appealing one. It is radical because
        it says
        that
        experience is the only thing that we directly know, that all our
        sense
        of
        the material world is constructed to better explain our
        subjective
        experience. It is not just that the mental is made primary and
        held
        above
        the physical, but that the subjective is raised over the
        objective.
      </p>
      <p>Subjectivity is the most distinctive aspect of this view of the
        mind, and
        inherent in it. If all of our understanding of the world arises
        from
        our
        experience, then it is inherently personal and specific to us. </p>
      <p>As scientists and observers we are accustomed to praising the
        objective and
        denigrating the subjective, so reversing this customary
        assessment
        requires
        some defense.
      </p>
      <p>The approach that I am advocating might be termed the <i>subjective
          viewpoint</i>. In it, all knowledge and understanding arises
        out of an
        individual's experience, and in that sense is inherently in
        terms that
        are
        private, personal, and subjective. An individual might know, for
        example,
        that a certain action tends to be followed by a certain
        sensation, or
        that
        one sensation invariably follows another. But these are <i>its</i>
        sensations and <i>its</i> actions. There is no necessary
        relationship
        between them and the sensations and actions of another
        individual. To
        hypothesize such a link might be useful, but always secondary to
        the
        subjective experience itself.
      </p>
      <p>The subjective view of knowledge and understanding might be
        constrasted
        with the objective, realist view. In this view there are such
        things as
        matter, physical objects, space and time, other people, etc.
        Things
        happen, and causally interact, largely independent of observers.
        Occasionally we experience something subjectively, but later
        determine
        that
        it did not really, objectively happen. For example, we felt the
        room
        get
        hot, but the thermometer registered no change. In this view
        there is a
        reality
        independent of our experience. This would be easy to deny if
        there were
        only one agent in the world. In that case it is clear that that
        agent
        is
        merely inventing things to explain its experience. The objective
        view
        gains much of its force because it can be shared by different
        people.
        In
        science, this is almost the definition of the
        subjective/objective
        distinction: that which is private to one person is subjective
        whereas
        that
        which can be observed by many, and replicated by others, is
        objective.
      </p>
      <p>I hasten to say that the subjective view does not deny the
        existence
        of the
        physical world. The conventional physical world is still the
        best
        hypothesis
        for explaining our subjective data. It is just that that world
        is held
        as
        secondary to the data that it is used to explain. And a little
        more: it
        is
        that the physical world hypothesis is just that, a hypothesis,
        an
        explanation. There are not two kinds of things, the mental and
        the
        physical. There are just mental things: the data of subjective
        experience
        and hypotheses constructed to explain it. </p>
      <p>The appeal of the subjective view is that it is grounded.
        Subjective
        experience can be viewed as data in need of explanation. There
        is a
        sense
        in which only the subjective is clear and unambiguous. "Whatever
        it
        means, I definitely <i>felt</i> warm in that room." No one can
        argue
        with
        our subjective experience, only with its explanation and
        relationship
        to
        other experiences that we have or might have. The closer the
        subjective
        is
        inspected, the firmer and less interpreted it appears, the more
        is
        becomes like data, whereas the objective often becomes vaguer
        and more
        complex. Consider the old saw about the person who saw red
        whenever
        everybody else saw green, and vice versa, but didn't realize it
        because
        he
        used the words "red" and "green" the wrong way around as well.
        This
        nonsense points out that different people's subjective
        experiences are
        not
        comparable. The experience that I call seeing red and the
        experience
        you
        call seeing red are related only in a very complicated way
        including,
        for
        example, effects of lighting, reflectance, viewpoint, and
        colored
        glasses. We have learned to use the same word to capture an
        important
        aspect of our
        separate experience, but ultimately the objective must bow to
        the
        subjective. </p>
      <p>The appeal of the objective view is that it is common across
        people.
        Something is objectively true if it predicts the outcome of
        experiments
        that you and I both can do and get the same answer. But how is
        this
        sensible? How can we get the same answer when you see with your
        eyes
        and I
        with mine? For that matter, how can we do the "same" experiment?
        All
        these
        are problematic and require extensive theories about what is the
        same
        and
        what is different. In particular, they require calibration of
        our
        senses
        with each other. It is not just a question of us using the same
        words
        for
        the same things -- the red/green example shows the folly of that
        kind
        of
        thinking -- it is that there is no satisfactory notion of same
        things,
        across individuals, at the level of experience. Subjective
        experience
        as
        the ultimate data is clear, but not the idea that it can be
        objectively
        compared across persons. That idea can be made to work,
        approximately,
        but
        should be seen as following from the primacy of subjective
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>At this point, you are probably wondering why I am belaboring
        this
        philosophical point. The reason is that the issue comes up,
        again and
        again, that it is difficult to avoid the pitfalls associated
        with the
        objective view without explicitly identifying them. This fate
        has
        befallen AI researchers many times in the past. So let us close
        with as
        clear a statement as we can of the implications of the
        subjective view
        for
        approaches to AI. What must be avoided, and what sought, in
        developing
        a
        subjective view of knowledge and mind?
      </p>
      <p>All knowledge must be expressed in terms that are ultimately
        subjective,
        that are expressed in terms of the data of experience, of
        sensation and
        action. Thus we seek ways of clearly expressing all kinds of
        human
        knowledge in subjective terms. This is a program usually
        associated
        with
        the term "associationism" and often denigrated. Perhaps it is
        impossible,
        but it should be tried, and it is difficult to disprove, like a
        null
        hypothesis. In addition to expressing knowledge subjectively, we
        should
        also
        look to ways of learning and working with subjective knowledge.
        How can
        we
        reason with subjective knowledge to obtain more knowledge? How
        can it
        be
        tested, verified, and learned? How can goals be expressed in
        subjective
        terms?
