<h1>The Definition of Intelligence</h1>
<h2>Rich Sutton</h2>
<h3>July 9, 2016<br>

<p>John McCarthy long ago gave one of the best definitions:
"Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals
in the world&#8221;. That is pretty straightforward and does not require a
lot of explanation. It also allows for intelligence to be a matter of
degree, and for intelligence to be of several varieties, which is as it
should be. Thus a person, a thermostat, a chess-playing program, and a
corporation all achieve goals to various degrees and in various senses.
For those looking for some ultimate &#8216;true intelligence&#8217;, the lack of an
absolute, binary definition is disappointing, but that is also as it
should be. <br>
<br>
The part that might benefit from explanation is what it means to
achieve goals. What does it mean to have a goal? How can I tell if a
system really has a goal rather than seems to? These questions seem
deep and confusing until you realize that a system having a goal or
not, despite the language, is not really a property of the system
itself. It is in the relationship between the system and an observer.
(In Dennett's words, it is a &#8216;stance&#8217; that the observer take with
respect to the system.) <br>
<br>
What is it in the relationship between the system and the observer that
makes it a goal-seeking system? It is that the system is most usefully
understood (predicted, controlled) in terms of its outcomes rather than
its mechanisms. Thus, for a home-owner a thermostat is most usefully
understood in terms of its keeping the temperature constant, as
achieving that outcome, as having that goal. But if i am an engineer
designing a thermostat, or a repairman fixing one, then i need to
understand it at a mechanistic level&#8212;and thus it does not have a goal.
The thermostat does or does not have a goal depending of the observer.
Another example is the person playing the chess computer. If I am a
naive person, and a weaker player, I can best understand the computer
as having the goal of beating me, of checkmating my king. But if I
wrote the chess program (and it does not look very deep) I have a
mechanistic way of understanding it that may be more useful for
predicting and controlling it (and beating it).<br>
<br>
Putting these two together, we can define intelligence concisely
(though without much hope of being genuinely understood without further
explanation):<br>

of the ability to achieve goals. A goal achieving system is one that is
more usefully understood in terms of outcomes than in terms of
mechanisms.<br>
