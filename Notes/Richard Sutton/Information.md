      <h2>Rich Sutton</h2>
      <h3>11/19/2001</h3>
      <p> What is the mind? Of course, "mind" is just a word, and we can
        mean anything we want by it. But if we examine the way we use
        the word, and think about the kinds of things we consider more
        mindful than others, I would argue that the idea of <i>choice</i>
        is the most important. We consider things to be more or less
        mindful to the extent that they appear to be making choices. To
        make a choice means to distinguish, and to create a difference.
        In this basic sense the mind is about <i>information</i>. Its
        essential function is to process bits into other bits. This
        position has two elements: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Mind is Computational, not Material </li>
        <li> Mind is Purposive </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Mind is Computational, not Material </h3>
      <p> The idea that the mind's activities are best viewed as
        information processing, as <i>computation</i>, has become
        predominant in our sciences over the last 40 years. People do
        not doubt that minds have physical, material form, of course,
        either as brains or perhaps as computer hardware. But, as is
        particularly obvious in the latter case, the hardware is often
        unimportant. Is is how the information flows which matters. </p>
      <p>I like to bring this idea down to our basest intuition. What
        things are more mindlike and less mindlike? A thermostat is
        slightly mindlike. It converts a gross physical quantity, the
        air temperature of your home, to a small deviation in a piece of
        metal, which tips a small lump of mercury which in turn triggers
        a fire in your furnace. Large physical events are reduced and
        processed as small ones, the physical is reduced to mere
        distinctions and processed as information. The sensors and
        effectors of our brains are essentially similar. Relatively
        powerful physical forces impinge on us, and our sensors convert
        them to tiny differences in nerve firings. These filter and are
        further processed until signals are sent to our muscles and
        there amplified into gross changes in our limbs and other large
        physical things. At all stages it is all physical, but inside
        our heads there are only small physical quantities that are
        easily altered and diverted as they interact with each other.
        This is what we mean by information processing. Information is
        not non-physical. It is a way of thinking about what is
        happening that is sometime much more revealing and useful than
        its physical properties. </p>
      <p>Or so is one view, the view that takes a material physical
        reality as primary. The informational view of mind is just as
        compatible with alternative philosophical orientations. The one
        I most appreciate is that which takes the individual mind and
        its exchanging of information with the world as the primary and
        base activity. This is the so-called "buttons and lights" model,
        in which the mind is isolated behind an interface of output bits
        (buttons) and input bits (lights). In this view, the idea of the
        physical world is created by the mind so as to explain the
        pattern of input bits and how they respond to the output bits.
        This is a cartoon view, certainly, but a very clear one. There
        is no confusion about mind and body, material and ideal. There
        is just information, distinctions observed and differences made.
      </p>
      <h3>Mind is Purposive </h3>
      <p> Implicit in the idea of choice, particularly as the essence of
        mindfulness, is some reason or purpose for making the choices.
        In fact it is difficult even to talk about choice without
        alluding to some purpose. One could say a rock "chooses" to do
        nothing, but only by suggesting that its purpose is to sit
        still. If a device generated decisions at random one would
        hesitate to say that it was "choosing." No, the whole idea of
        choice implies purpose, a reason for making the choice. </p>
      <p>Purposiveness is at heart of mindfulness, and the heart of
        purposiveness is the varying of means to achieve fixed ends.
        William James in 1890 identified this as "the mark and criterion
        of mentality". He discussed an air bubble rising rising in water
        until trapped in an inverted jar, contrasting it with a frog,
        which may get trapped temporarily but keeps trying things until
        it finds a way around the jar. Varying means and fixed ends. In
        AI we call it generate and test. Or trial and error. Variation
        and selective survival. There are many names and many
        variations, but this idea is the essence of purpose, choice, and
        Mind. </p>
