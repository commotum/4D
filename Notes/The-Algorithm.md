# **Elon Musk’s “Algorithm” for Engineering and Process Design**

### **The Five-Step Framework**

A structured sequence intended to prevent premature optimization and ensure that fundamentals are addressed first:

1. **Make the requirement less dumb.**
   Every requirement should be questioned. Even (especially) those from “experts.”

2. **Delete the part or process.**
   *“The most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize a thing that should not exist.”*
   The highest-leverage action in engineering is removing steps, constraints, or components entirely.

3. **Simplify and optimize.**
   Only after you remove the unnecessary parts should you streamline what remains.

4. **Accelerate cycle time.**
   Speed up production or iteration, but only after steps 1–3. Otherwise you’re just making bad processes happen faster.

5. **Automate last.**
   Engineers love to automate too early, which can lock in bad designs.
