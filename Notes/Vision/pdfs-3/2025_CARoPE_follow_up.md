Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 1
- Next-token prediction (language modeling) on FineWeb-Edu-10B. (`Notes/Vision/pdfs-3/2025_CARoPE.txt:44`, `Notes/Vision/pdfs-3/2025_CARoPE.txt:80`)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1
- The paper evaluates only next-token prediction tasks using GPT-2 variants, so a single trained model instance can cover the single task. (`Notes/Vision/pdfs-3/2025_CARoPE.txt:147`)

$$
\boxed{
\frac{1\ \text{task}}{1\ \text{model}} = 1
}
