Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 4.
- Image generation on ImageNet (class-conditional). (2024_FPD.txt:324-327)
- Image generation on CelebA-HQ (unconditional). (2024_FPD.txt:324-327)
- Image generation on LSUN-Church (unconditional). (2024_FPD.txt:324-327)
- Image generation on FFHQ (unconditional). (2024_FPD.txt:324-327)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 4.
- Separate dataset-specific models are trained (ImageNet trained for four days; other datasets trained separately for one day), implying one model per dataset. (2024_FPD.txt:331-334)

\boxed{
\frac{4\ \text{tasks}}{4\ \text{models}} = 1
