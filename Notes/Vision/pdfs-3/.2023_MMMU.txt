Figure 3. The comparison between MMMU and other existing benchmarks. MMMU excels in both its breadth to cover a wide range of
disciplines and its depth to test LMMs’ reasoning abilities. In the image format, V means visual input, OC means optical characters, MC
means multi-choice. Repurposed means the benchmark is a compilation of prior datasets.

Question: The artist's use of color and neutral tones helps convey primarily which of the following
themes? <image 1>
Option:
(A) the inequities of societies
(B) the innocence of youth
(C) the conveniences of technology
(D) the threat of climate change




         <image 1>
GPT-4V: The artist's use of color and neutral tones in this picture, along with the chosen imagery,
helps convey the theme of "the inequities of societies" (A). The contrast between the small child
laboring to pull the rickshaw and the larger, relaxed adults taking a selfie is a stark commentary on
social and economic disparities. The neutral background emphasizes the subjects, drawing the
viewer's attention to the inequality presented within the scene.

Ground Truth: (A) the inequities of societies
Explanation: The work depicts a small boy pulling a rickshaw in which two adults are seated. The
boy, the rickshaw, and the background are all depicted with shades of gray and black. By contrast,
the couple in the rickshaw is depicted in full color. Even without this use of color, the work would
convey a theme of inequity because a little boy is pulling two adults, who seem to represent
Western culture. The color contrast underscores the theme because one culture is depicted as bright,
happy, and colorful, while the other is depicted as small and drab.

Question: A main function of castles was to provide a defense against invaders. This was achieved
by several devices, including water-filled moats and barbicans, high stone walls surrounding the
castle. Another such device was battlements (or crenellations). These were alternating sections of
wall, called merlons, and openings, called embrasures. The embrasures were used for firing arrows.
They also permitted boulders to be dropped on attackers attempting to scale the castle walls. If you
were going to write an alternate caption for <image 1>, you might note that this castle was
equipped with
Option:
(A) a barbican and a moat.
(B) merlons but not embrasures.
(C) a moat and crenellations.
(D) a barbican and battlements.




            <image 1>
GPT-4V: The correct alternate caption for the image based on the provided information would be:
(C) a moat and crenellations.

Error Category: Perceptual Error
Error Reason: GPT-4V fails to interpret the image. Based on the image and the explanation, the
analysis should be 'we cannot actually see if there is a moat or not'. However, GPT-4V incorrectly
thinks there's a moat and gives a wrong answer.

Ground Truth: (D) a barbican and battlements.
Explanation: We can see that the castle has outer walls with battlements on top, but we cannot
actually see if there is a moat or not.

Option:
(A) hierarchical scale
(B) graphic representation of horror and despair
(C) a sense of immediacy and drama
(D) use of sharply contrasting light and shade




           <image 1>

GPT-4V: Based on the painting provided:
(A) hierarchical scale - This technique, where figures or objects are represented in varying sizes to
    indicate their relative importance or position in the narrative, is evident in the painting. The
    central figures are larger and more pronounced, while secondary figures and elements are
    smaller or placed in the background.
(B) graphic representation of horror and despair - This is clearly exhibited in the painting. The
    expressions on the faces of the figures, their body language, and the overall chaotic scene depict
    horror and despair.
(C) a sense of immediacy and drama - The dynamic poses, facial expressions, and the chaotic nature
    of the scene give a strong sense of immediacy and drama.
(D) use of sharply contrasting light and shade - The painting employs a technique known as
    chiaroscuro, where light and shade are used to give depth, volume, and a three-dimensional
    effect to the subjects. This is evident in the way light falls on certain figures, highlighting them,
    while others are in shadow.
Given these observations, the correct answer is:
(A) hierarchical scale.

Ground Truth: (A) hierarchical scale

GPT-4V: This painting is "Las Meninas" by Diego Velázquez. The original placement of this
painting was (A) in the Prado Museum in Madrid, showing a willingness to be compared to great
Spanish painters of the past.

Error Category: Lack of knowledge
Error Reason: GPT-4V successfully recognizes that the painting is Las Meninas (1656), painted by
Velazquez, showcasing its perceptual ability. However, it does not know the fact that the work was
placed in the study of King Philip IV. GPT-4V suggests that the painting was placed in Prado
Museum in Madrid, and even provides a reason to support this answer, which is the willingness to
be compared to great Spanish painters in the past. This shows some reasoning ability. However, the
original placement is a piece of factual knowledge; the reasoning was based on incorrect knowledge
and it led to a wrong answer. This behavior illustrates that GPT-4V lacks specific art knowledge.

Ground Truth: (C) in the study of King Philip IV, challenging him to consider the multitude of
interpretations the painting represents

Option:
(A) consumerism and national identities
(B) flight paths and time intervals
(C) sports car and racing signage
(D) information systems on the Internet




            <image 1>

GPT-4V: The painting (<image 1>) appears to be a complex and abstract representation with
various lines, patterns, and colors. Based on the visual elements in the painting:(D) information
systems on the Internetseems to be the most fitting description. The interconnected lines and
vibrant, diverse patterns might suggest the vastness and complexity of information systems on the
Internet. However, art interpretation can be subjective, and different viewers may see different
meanings in the same piece.


Error Category: Perceptual Error
Error Reason: The model failed to recognize and interpret the symbolic elements of national flags
present in the image, which are key indicators of 'consumerism and national identities', leading to
an incorrect answer.


Ground Truth: (D) information systems on the Internet
Explanation: The painting reflects contemporary culture's consumerism and national identities
through its visual elements that evoke the commercial marketplace and specific country symbols.
Bright colors and recognizable patterns may suggest mass-produced goods and advertising, a
common commentary on consumer culture in contemporary art. Additionally, abstract
representations of flags, national colors, or iconic images could signify different countries' identities,
illustrating the global interconnectedness of consumerism where products and brands cross borders
and adapt to local cultures. The painting's complexity and layering mirror the saturated,
interconnected nature of our globalized world, where the flow of consumer goods and cultural
symbols creates a vibrant, dynamic map of modern life.

Option:
(A) barrel-vaulted roofing
(B) decorative rhythm and repetition
(C) a higher roof to make up for the short columns
(D) the entrance of light and air into the hall




                   False




                    <image 1>

GPT-4V: The double-tiered columns in the image provided would allow for: (A) barrel-vaulted
roofing (B) decorative rhythm and repetition (C) a higher roof to make up for the short columns.
However, the double-tiered columns would not directly affect: (D) the entrance of light and air into
the hall. So the correct answer is (D) the entrance of light and air into the hall.


Error Category: Lack of Knowledge
Error Reason: The error reason is a lack of specific subject knowledge: the incorrect response
suggests that double-tiered columns would not affect the entrance of light and air, which is not
necessarily true. Architecturally, double-tiered columns do not prevent light and air from entering;
such features are more influenced by the building's windows and overall design rather than the
column structure itself. The correct answer should be that double-tiered columns would not allow
for barrel-vaulted roofing, as the Mezquita features flat ceilings above the arches.


Ground Truth: (A) barrel-vaulted roofing
Explanation: The double-tiered columns depicted in the image, characteristic of Islamic architecture
like that found in the Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba, are not designed to support a barrel-vaulted
roof; instead, they serve other purposes. These arches create a visually striking pattern of rhythm
and repetition, elevate the roofline by stacking arches, which compensates for the shorter columns,
and contribute to the structure's stability. However, they are not related to the entrance of light and
air, which is typically managed by windows, nor are they structurally supportive of a barrel-
vaulted roof, as their design and construction cater to a flat roofing system. Hence, the correct
answer is "barrel-vaulted roofing," as it is the element not facilitated by the double-tiered columns.

GPT-4V: The correct tuning for a violin is shown in the first image. The violin is typically tuned to
the pitches G3, D4, A4, and E5, starting from the lowest string to the highest. In the image, the G-
clef (treble clef) is used for the E and A strings, while the C-clef (alto clef) is used for the D string,
and the F-clef (bass clef) for the G string. This notation is a way to visually represent the correct
tuning pitches for the violin's four strings.

  Question: Choose the name for the following interval. <image 1>
  Option:
  (A) Perfect 6th
  (B) Compound perfect 4th
  (C) Major 6th
  (D) Minor 6th




           <image 1>
  GPT-4V: The interval shown in the image is a “major 6th.” It spans from the first note, F, to the
  second note, D. In a standard diatonic scale, the interval from F to D is a sixth, and since the key
  signature does not indicate any flats or sharps that would alter the D, it remains a major sixth. The
  options “perfect 6th” and “compound perfect 4th” do not exist in music theory as “perfect” is used
  for unison, 4th, 5th, and octave intervals. A "minor 6th" would require the D to be flattened, which
  is not the case here.

  Error Category: Perceptual Error, Lack of knowledge
  Error Reason: The model immediately recognized it as a 6th interval, but got confused whether it's
  a major 6th or a minor 6th. A closer look at the response reveals that the model failed to recognize
  the starting and ending notes of the interval. The first note is actually G, but the model mistook it
  for the adjacent not F. The second note is Eb, and the model might have simply deduced that it was
  D based on the assumption of major 6th + F. Additionally, the model's mistaken identification of a
  compound perfect 4th indicates a lack of subject knowledge.

  Ground Truth: (D) Minor 6th

                        <image 1>
GPT-4V: In response to your inquiry, I examined the provided image for the presence of a
compound minor third interval in the right-hand part starting from bar 13. A compound minor
third, or a tenth, combines an octave (twelve semitones) with a minor third (three semitones),
totaling fifteen semitones. Upon inspection, I found that bar 17 doesn't have this interval in the
right-hand part. Bars 14 and 15 do contain intervals, but I'm uncertain if any are a compound minor
third. I can't confirm the presence of this interval in bars 28 and 29, as they're not visible in the
image. Bar 18 also requires checking for this interval. Unfortunately, I can't process the image
visually to provide the exact bar number of the specified interval.

Error Category: Perceptual Error
Error Reason: Surprisingly, the model fails to find the corresponding bar number based on the
relative location of labeled bars. This is a simple visual inference task for humans.

Question: Consider the three stocks in the following table. Pt represents price at time t, and Qt
represents shares outstanding at time t. Stock C splits two for one in the last period. Calculate the
rate of return on a price-weighted index of the three stocks for the first period ( t 0 to t 1).
Option:

(B) 4.03%
(C) 3.89%




                             <image 1>

GPT-4V: To calculate the rate of return on a price-weighted index of the three stocks for the first
period (t0 to t1), follow these steps: Calculate the initial index value at t0. Calculate the index value
at t1. Compute the rate of return using the two index values.
Initial Index Value at t0:
Price-weighted index value at 𝑡0 = (𝑃0(𝐴) + 𝑃0(𝐵) + 𝑃0(𝐶)) / 3
 = (90 + 50 + 100) / 3
 = 80
Index Value at t1:
Price-weighted index value at 𝑡1 = (𝑃1(𝐴) + 𝑃1(𝐵) + 𝑃1(𝐶)) / 3
 = (95 + 45 + 110) / 3
 = 83.33
Rate of Return:
Rate of Return = (Index Value at t1 - Index Value at t0) / Index Value at t0
 = (83.33 − 80) / 80
 = 0.041625
 = 4.1625%
Therefore, the rate of return on a price-weighted index of the three stocks for the first period is
approximately 4.17%.
The correct answer is:
(A) 4.17%

Ground Truth: (A) 𝟒. 𝟏𝟕%
Explanation: At t = 0, the value of the index is: (90 + 50 + 100)/3 = 80. At 𝑡 = 1, the value of
the index is: (95 + 45 + 110)/3 = 83.333. The rate of return is: (83.333/80) − 1 = 4.17%

  GPT-4V: To calculate the retained earnings to be reported for Company Y from the adjusted trial
  balance, we need to consider the following components:
    1. Beginning Retained Earnings: This would be the retained earnings balance at the start of the
  period. However, since it is not provided, we can assume it is included in the current retained
  earnings figure in the trial balance or that this is the first year of operation, and as such, it would be
  zero.
    2. Add: Net Income (or Less: Net Loss): Net income is calculated as revenues minus expenses. If
  expenses exceed revenues, it results in a net loss.
    3. Less: Dividends: These are distributions to shareholders, which reduce retained earnings.
  From the adjusted trial balance provided, the calculation would be as follows:
  Net Income: Service Revenue ($74,000) - (Insurance Expense $5,600 + Salaries Expense $24,000 +
  Miscellaneous Expense $22,800) = $74,000 - $52,400 = $21,600.
  Less Dividends: $8,000. Retained Earnings to be Reported = Beginning Retained Earnings (if not
  given, assumed to be included in the trial balance) + Net Income - Dividends. The trial balance
  shows Retained Earnings as $6,000. Assuming this is the beginning balance and adding the net
  income less dividends: Retained Earnings to be Reported = $6,000 + $21,600 - $8,000 = $19,600.
  There is no answer matching the option.

  Error Category: Perceptual Error
  Error Reason: GPT-4V understands the question and can know how to calculate the Retained
  Earnings to be Reported. Most of the calculation process is correct. However, in the final steps,
  GPT-4V wrongly extracts the number of Retained Earnings from the table image (should be $4,200
  instead of $6,000).

  Ground Truth: (A) $17,800

(C) Both time series display a trending behavior




       <image 1>                        <image 2>
GPT-4V: Based on the provided figures:(A) IPIt displays a strong seasonality. - This statement
appears to be TRUE. Figure 2 shows consistent and repeating peaks and valleys for the Spanish
Industrial Production Index (IPIt), indicative of seasonality.(B) Both time series are mean stationary.
- This statement appears to be FALSE. A mean stationary time series would have a constant mean
(average) over time. Both figures show a changing mean over the given time frames, particularly
Figure 1 where the mean value for Melanoma cases appears to be increasing over time.(C) Both time
series display a trending behavior. - This statement appears to be TRUE. Figure 1 shows an upward
trend in the number of Melanoma cases over time, and Figure 2 displays fluctuations but also an
overall upward trend in the Industrial Production Index. Therefore, the FALSE statement is:
(B) Both time series are mean stationary.

Question: Question below is based on the production possibilities of two nations that can produce
both crepes and paper. <image 1> Which of the following statements is true of these production
possibilities?
Option:
(A) Nation X has comparative advantage in paper production and should trade paper to Nation Y
in exchange for crepes.
(B) Nation X has comparative advantage in crepe production and should trade crepes to Nation Y
in exchange for paper
(C) Nation X has absolute advantage in paper production, and Nation Y has absolute advantage in
crepe production. No trade is possible.
(D) Nation Y has absolute advantage in paper production, and Nation X has absolute advantage in
crepe production. No trade is possible.
(E) Nation Y has comparative advantage in crepe production and should trade paper to Nation X in
exchange for crepes.




                       <image 1>
GPT-4V: To determine which nation has a comparative advantage in producing a particular good,
we need to calculate the opportunity cost for each good in both nations. Opportunity cost is
calculated as the amount of the other good that has to be given up to produce one unit of a
particular good. Opportunity cost for Nation X: For 1 crepe, Nation X gives up producing 3 units of
paper. So, opportunity cost of 1 crepe = 3 paper. For 1 paper, Nation X gives up producing 1/3 unit
of crepe. So, opportunity cost of 1 paper = 1/3 crepe. Opportunity cost for Nation Y:For 1 crepe,
Nation Y gives up producing 5 units of paper. So, opportunity cost of 1 crepe = 5 paper. For 1
paper, Nation Y gives up producing 1/5 unit of crepe. So, opportunity cost of 1 paper = 1/5 crepe.
Comparing opportunity costs: Nation X has a lower opportunity cost (1/3 < 1/5) in producing
paper than Nation Y. So, Nation X has a comparative advantage in producing paper. Nation Y has a
lower opportunity cost (5 > 3) in producing crepes than Nation X. So, Nation Y has a comparative
advantage in producing crepes. Given this, the statement:
(A) Nation X has comparative advantage in paper production and should trade paper to Nation Y
in exchange for crepes.is the correct answer.
Error Category: Perceptual Error
Error Reason: Although GPT-4V correctly identifies the numbers in the table, it fails to correctly
attribute these numbers to the correct objects for production. For example, when calculating the
opportunity cost of Nation X, GPT-4V makes the mistake that nation X can either produce 3 units of
crepe or 9 units of piece. But in fact, according to the table, nation X can produce 3 units of paper or
9 units of crepe. This error leads to the incorrect calculation of opportunity cost and the incorrect
answer.

Ground Truth: (A) Nation X has comparative advantage in paper production and should trade
paper to Nation Y in exchange for crepes.

Question: Spike Equino is the CEO of a private medical equipment company that is proposing to
sell 100,000 shares of its stock in an open auction. Suppose the company receives the bids in the
following table. <image 1> What will be the company's total receipts ($) from the sale if the auction
is a uniform price auction?




        <image 1>

GPT-4V: In a uniform price auction, all successful bidders pay the same price per share, which is
the lowest price at which the entire quantity can be sold. To determine this price, we need to
accumulate the bids starting from the highest price until the total number of shares reaches or
exceeds the quantity being sold (100,000 shares in this case). Using the given table: 20,000 shares at
$8010,000 shares at $7815,000 shares at $7325,000 shares at $7010,000 shares at $698,000 shares at
$6714,000 shares at $6615,000 shares at $6530,000 shares at $61. Accumulating the shares: 20,000
shares (total: 20,000) 10,000 shares (total: 30,000) 15,000 shares (total: 45,000) 25,000 shares (total:
70,000) 10,000 shares (total: 80,000) 8,000 shares (total: 88,000) 14,000 shares (total: 102,000). We can
see that after accumulating the first 7 bids, we exceed the 100,000 shares being sold. Therefore, the
price that every successful bidder will pay is $66 per share (which is the lowest bid price that allows
the company to sell all 100,000 shares). To calculate the company's total receipts from the sale:
100,000 shares × $66/share = $6,600,000.
The company's total receipts from the sale will be $6,600,000.

Ground Truth: $6600000

Question: <image 1> Which point designates the optimal portfolio of risky assets?
Option:
(A) Point E
(B) Point F
(C) Point G
(D) Point H




                      <image 1>
GPT-4V: The optimal portfolio of risky assets is the one that provides the highest expected return
for a given level of risk. On the Capital Market Line (CML) or Capital Allocation Line (CAL)
depicted in the graph, this is represented by the tangent point where the CAL touches the efficient
frontier (the curve of possible portfolios).From the graph provided, Point F is where the CAL is
tangent to the efficient frontier, which means Point F designates the optimal portfolio of risky
assets. The answer is: (B) Point F.

Error Category: Reasoning Error
Error Reason: GPT-4V accurately identifies point F as the optimal portfolio of risky assets in the
given problem and applies the correct theoretical framework in its reasoning. However, it overlooks
an important aspect of point E, which also lies on the Capital Allocation Line (CAL) and is situated
at the CAL's rightmost end. Given that point E offers a higher expected return while maintaining
the same Sharpe ratio as point F, it should be considered more optimal than point F. This oversight
in GPT-4V's analysis leads to an incorrect conclusion, as it fails to adequately assess the significance
of point E in the context of portfolio optimization.

Ground Truth: (A) Point E

Question: Eastern Chemical Company produces three products. The operating results of the
current year are: <image 1> The firm sets the target price of each product at 150% of the product's
total manufacturing cost. It appears that the firm was able to sell Product C at a much higher price
than the target price of the product and lost money on Product B. Tom Watson, CEO, wants to
promote Product C much more aggressively and phase out Product B. He believes that the
information suggests that Product C has the greatest potential among the firm's three products
because the actual selling price of Product C was almost 50% higher than the target price, while the
firm was forced to sell Product B at a price below the target price. Both the budgeted and actual
factory overhead for the current year are $510,000. The actual units sold for each product also are
the same as the budgeted units. The firm uses direct labor dollars to assign manufacturing overhead
costs. The direct materials and direct labor costs per unit for each product are: <image 2> The

                 <image 3>

GPT-4V: To determine the manufacturing cost per unit for Product A using the volume-based
method, we'll follow these steps: Calculate the total overhead rate. Calculate the total
manufacturing cost for Product A. Calculate the manufacturing cost per unit for Product A.1.
Calculate the total overhead rate: Overhead rate = Total Factory Overhead / Total Direct Labor
Dollars. Using the information given: Total Factory Overhead = $510,000, Direct labor cost for:
Product A = $20.00, Product B = $12.00, Product C = $10.00. Sales Quantity: Product A = 1,000 units,
Product B = 5,000 units, Product C = 500 units. Total Direct Labor Dollars = (Product A direct labor
cost per unit × Product A Sales Quantity) + (Product B direct labor cost per unit × Product B Sales
Quantity) + (Product C direct labor cost per unit × Product C Sales Quantity) = ($20.00 × 1,000) +
($12.00 × 5,000) + ($10.00 × 500)= $20,000 + $60,000 + $5,000= $85,000
Overhead Rate:= Total Factory Overhead / Total Direct Labor Dollars= $510,000 / $85,000 = $6 per
direct labor dollar2. Calculate the total manufacturing cost for Product A:Manufacturing cost =
Direct Materials + Direct Labor + Overhead. Using the information given for Product A:Direct
Materials = $50.00, Direct Labor = $20.00, Overhead = Overhead Rate × Direct Labor= $6 × $20.00=
$120.00Total Manufacturing Cost for Product A:= Direct Materials + Direct Labor + Overhead=
$50.00 + $20.00 + $120.00= $190.003. Calculate the manufacturing cost per unit for Product A:Since
the actual units sold for each product are the same as the budgeted units, we can use the given sales
quantity for Product A:Manufacturing Cost Per Unit for Product A:= Total Manufacturing Cost for
Product A / Product A Sales Quantity= $190,000 units= $0.19 per unit (This seems too low, there
might be an error in our calculations or in the given data.).
However, since we're asked for the manufacturing cost per unit, $190.00 is the correct
manufacturing cost per unit for Product A using the volume-based method.

Ground Truth: $190

               <image 1>

GPT-4V: The image depicts a case of myopia, or nearsightedness. In myopia, light entering the eye
is focused in front of the retina rather than directly on it, which results in distant objects appearing
blurred. Given the choices:(A) Vision may be restored with concave lens and refractive surgery -
This is correct. A concave lens can help to spread out the light rays so that they can focus on the
retina correctly. Additionally, refractive surgeries like LASIK can help correct myopia.(B) Vision
may be restored with convex lens and refractive surgery - This is incorrect. Convex lenses are used
for hyperopia or farsightedness, not myopia.(C) This condition often occurs in elderly people - This
is not necessarily true. Myopia can begin in childhood and progress into adulthood. It is not limited
to elderly people.(D) This phenomenon can not be fixed by LASIK (laser-assisted in situ
keratomileusis) surgery - This is incorrect. LASIK is one of the common surgeries used to correct
myopia.So, the true statement is:
(A) Vision may be restored with concave lens and refractive surgery.

Question: Consider the figure <image 1> for ABC hypothesis. If wild type Arabidopsis were

sequence, which of the following arrangements (inner to outer) would be predicted?
Option:
(A) Ca, St, St, St.
(B) Ca, St, Se, Se.
(C) Ca, St, Se, Pe.
(D) Ca, St, Pe, Se.
(E) Ca, St, St, Ca.




           <image 1>

GPT-4V: The ABC model is a classic model for understanding flower development. This model
stipulates that: A-class genes alone specify sepals. A-class and B-class genes together specify
petals. B-class and C-class genes together specify stamens. C-class genes alone specify carpels.
Given the information, if a wild type Arabidopsis were transformed with a chimeric gene consisting
of an A class promoter fused to a B class coding sequence, then the B class gene would be expressed
where normally only the A class gene would be active. Here's how the flower would develop
according to the modified ABC model: Whorl 1 (outermost): Normally A class genes would specify
sepals, but with the B class coding sequence under the A class promoter, it would be A+B which
specifies petals.
Whorl 2: A + B class genes together specify petals, and this remains unchanged.
Whorl 3: Normally B + C class genes together would specify stamens. This remains unchanged.
Whorl 4 (innermost): C class genes alone specify carpels, and this remains unchanged. So the new
arrangement from innermost to outermost would be:
Ca, St, Pe, Pe. So, the arrangement from outermost to innermost would be:
Pe, Pe, St, Ca The closest match to the given options would be:
(D) Ca, St, Pe, Se.

Error Category: Reasoning Error
Error Reason: GPT-4V correctly interprets the image. However, it does not correctly reason about
the relationship between a 'coding sequence' and a 'class promoter'. This prevents it from correctly
predicting the answer for Whorl 1 and Whorl 2.

of the following will be the most likely outcome?
Option:
(A) The mouse may develop one head and one tail
(B) The mouse may develop two heads and no tail
(C) The mouse may develop no head and two tails




           <image 1>

GPT-4V: The Hox genes are a group of related genes that control the body plan of an embryo along
the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. These genes determine where limbs and other body segments
will grow in a developing fetus.
In the image provided, you appear to reference a mouse with a head and a tail, with what seems to
be color-coding or sequencing perhaps representing the Hox genes.
To understand the likely outcome, it's essential to consider the function of Hox genes:
Hox 1 genes are typically expressed in anterior regions of the body, such as the head.
Hox 13 genes are typically expressed in posterior regions, like the tail.
Given this information, if a Hox 13 gene in a mouse was replaced with a Hox 1 gene, the posterior
region where the tail would normally develop would now be getting instructions to develop
anterior structures.
Therefore, the most likely outcome is:
(C) The mouse may develop no head and two tails.

Error Category: Reasoning Error
Error Reason: GPT-4V accurately interpreted the image and correctly recalled that “Hox 1 genes are
typically expressed in anterior regions of the body, such as the head. Hox 13 genes are typically
expressed in posterior regions, like the tail.” The model also correctly processed most of the
intermediate reasoning steps. However, the concluding statement “The mouse may develop no
head and two tails” does not logically follow from the prior step: “the posterior region where the
tail would normally develop would now be getting instructions to develop anterior structures.”

Ground Truth: (B) The mouse may develop two heads and no tail

Question: The diagram in <image 1> represents a section of undisturbed layers of sedimentary rock
in New York State and shows the location of fossils of several closely related species. According to
currently accepted evolutionary theory, which is the most probable assumption about species A, B
and C?
Option:
(A) Species B is more abundant than species C
(B) Species A and B are genetically identical
(C) Both species A and C are descended from species B
(D) Species B descended from species A
(E) Species C existed before species B




                        <image 1>

GPT-4V: The diagram depicts layers of sedimentary rock with fossils of different species.
In sedimentary rock layers, the oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest layers are at the
top. Based on this, the order of appearance of the species from oldest to youngest is: Species C →
Species B → Species A (and then A continues to exist with B). Given this order and the choices
provided, the most probable assumption according to currently accepted evolutionary theory is:
(D) Species B descended from species A.

Error Category: Reasoning Error
Error Reason: GPT-4V correctly understands the evolutionary order of A, B and C (C → B → A).
But D is a contradiction of this timeline order.

Ground Truth: (E) Species C existed before species B

(A) 2R, 3S
(B) 2S, 3R
(C) 2S, 3S
(D) 2R, 3R




       <image 1>
GPT-4V: To determine the configuration (R or S) of a chiral center, we follow the Cahn-Ingold-
Prelog (CIP) priority rules: Assign priorities based on atomic number. The atom bonded to the
chiral center with the highest atomic number gets the highest priority (1). If two atoms have the
same atomic number, consider the atoms they are bonded to in order to determine priority. Orient
the molecule so that the atom or group with the lowest priority (4) is pointing away (in the
background). Observe the order of groups 1-2-3: If the order is clockwise, the configuration is R. If
the order is counterclockwise, the configuration is S. Let‘s determine the configuration for the two
chiral centers: For C-2: Attached groups and their atomic numbers: CH3 (Carbon = 6)Cl (Chlorine =
17)H (Hydrogen = 1)C2H5 (Carbon = 6, but this will have higher priority than CH3 because the
subsequent carbons in the chain will be used for breaking the tie). Priority order: ClC2H5CH3H.
With the H pointing to the background, the order is 1 (Cl) to 2 (C2H5) to 3 (CH3), which is
clockwise. So, the configuration at C-2 is R. For C-3: Attached groups and their atomic numbers: H
(Hydrogen = 1)Cl (Chlorine = 17)CH3 (Carbon = 6)C2H5 (Carbon = 6, but like before, C2H5 will
have higher priority than CH3). Priority order: ClC2H5CH3H. With the H pointing to the
background, the order is 1 (Cl) to 2 (C2H5) to 3 (CH3), which is counterclockwise. So, the
configuration at C-3 is S. Therefore, the correct configuration for the compound is: 2R, 3S. So, the
answer is (A) 2R, 3S.

Ground Truth: (A) 2R, 3S

(A) It is likely to be SN1.
(B) It is likely to be SN2.
(C) None of the above.

GPT-4V: The reaction depicted involves the conversion of an alcohol to an alkyl chloride in the
presence of HCl and CH₃OH (methanol). Given the reagents and conditions:(A) It is likely to be
SN1.The alcohol initially forms a carbocation intermediate after losing the hydroxyl group in the
presence of HCl. Then, chloride ion attacks the carbocation to form the alkyl chloride product. The
mechanism of this reaction is consistent with the SN1 pathway.

       GPT-4V: Let's analyze each of the Lewis structures:(a) SO₂: The structure shows sulfur with a
       double bond to each oxygen atom. Each oxygen atom has two lone pairs, and sulfur has no lone
       pairs. This is the correct Lewis structure for SO₂.(b) NH₃: The structure shows nitrogen with a
       single bond to each of the three hydrogen atoms and one lone pair on nitrogen. This is the correct
       Lewis structure for NH₃.(c) NO₂⁺: The structure shows nitrogen with a double bond to one oxygen
       and a single bond to the other oxygen. The single bonded oxygen has three lone pairs, while the
       double bonded oxygen has two lone pairs. This results in the nitrogen having a positive charge.
       This is the correct Lewis structure for NO₂⁺.(d) NH₄Cl: The structure shows the ammonium ion
       (NH₄⁺) with nitrogen having four single bonds to four hydrogen atoms, and there's no lone pair on
       nitrogen. However, chlorine is shown with a single bond to a hydrogen atom, which is incorrect.
       Chlorine should not be bonded to hydrogen in this structure. Instead, NH₄⁺ and Cl⁻ are present as
       ions, and they are attracted to each other through ionic bonding.(e) NH₄Cl: This structure shows the
       correct ionic representation with the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) and the chloride ion (Cl⁻) as separate
       entities. Based on the analysis, the incorrect Lewis structure is: (d) NH₄Cl. The correct answer is: (D)
       (d) and (e)

       Error Category: Perceptual Error, Reasoning Error
       Error Reason: For choice (a), GPT-4V incorrectly recognizes the carbon atom as a sulfur atom, and
       even if it was a sulfur atom, there would be two electrons near the sulfur atom. Therefore, the Lewis
       structure in choice (a) is completely wrong and should be one of the final answers. For choice (e),

  GPT-4V: The graph provided is a phase diagram, which illustrates the conditions (in terms of
  pressure and temperature) under which different phases of a substance coexist in equilibrium. In
  such a diagram: The line between the solid and gas regions represents the sublimation/deposition
  equilibrium, where a substance can transition directly between the solid and gaseous states. The
  line between the solid and liquid regions represents the melting/freezing equilibrium. The line
  between the liquid and gas regions represents the boiling/condensation equilibrium. From the
  image provided, point (B) 3 is on the line between the solid and gas regions, representing the
  sublimation/deposition equilibrium. So, the correct answer is: (B) 3.

  Error Category: Lack of Knowledge
  Error Reason: The model correctly describes the knowledge, but due to the lack of knowledge
  about the phase diagram, it thinks point 3 is the one on the line between the solid and gas regions,

       Landsat 7 is in a different path while Terra and Aqua are both in the 705 path. So 3 definitely
       represents Landsat 7. GPT-4V ignores the hint provided in the diagram. Given the fact that GPT-4V

Question: Consider <image 1> on the torus, with its faces labeled A through H. Give a colouring of
the faces of with four colours so that faces meeting along an edge have different colours. Is such
colouring possible with only three colours?
Option:
(A) Yes
(B) No




        <image 1>

GPT-4V: To solve the problem, we can start by attempting to color the diagram with three colors
and see if it's possible to do so without having two adjacent faces of the same color. Let's label our
three colors as Red, Green, and Blue (for the sake of this explanation).We can begin by coloring face
A with Red. Adjacent to A are B and C, so let's color B with Green and C with Blue. D is adjacent to
both B and C, so it must be Red. E is adjacent to A, D, and B. Since A and D are Red and B is Green,
E should be Blue. F is adjacent to C, D, and E. D is Red, E is Blue, so F should be Green. G is
adjacent to D, F, and A. D is Red, F is Green, so G should be Blue. Lastly, H is adjacent to B, E, and
F. B is Green, E is Blue, and F is Green. So H can be colored Red. From this coloring, it seems that
we can color the diagram with three colors such that no two adjacent faces have the same color.
Hence, the answer is:(A) Yes.

Error Category: Perceptual Error
Error Reason: GPT-4V encounters an issue in the third step of reasoning, when it concludes, "D is
adjacent to both B and C, so it must be Red." The problem begins at this point because, according to
the image, D is actually adjacent to A, B, and C. The error should be identified at this step, but the
model recognizes incomplete information, believing that D is only adjacent to B and C, which leads
to a series of subsequent incorrect deductions.

Ground Truth: (B) No

Option:
(A) 38
(B) 44
(C) 88
(D) 96




             <image 1>

GPT-4V: Using the properties of inscribed angles and their intercepted arcs, we can deduce: The
measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.When two chords are
parallel, the inscribed angles that intercept the same arc are congruent.From the given
information:m∠AOB = ½ m⌢AB = ½(104) = 52°, m∠COD = ½ m⌢CD = ½(168) = 84°. Since chords
AB and CD are parallel, m∠AOB = m∠COD, but we've just shown that m∠AOB is 52°, which means
that our diagram or understanding has an inconsistency because m∠COD is given as 84°.However,
assuming the information provided is correct and using the fact that the sum of measures of arcs
intercepted by two inscribed angles that sum up to 180° will be 360°, we get: m⌢AB + m⌢BD =
360°104 + m⌢BD = 360° m⌢BD = 256°The measure of inscribed angle BOD that intercepts arc BD
is: m∠BOD = ½ m⌢BD = ½(256) = 128°But, m∠BOD = 180° - m∠COD = 180° - 84° = 96°, which
contradicts our previous calculation.Assuming the latter to be correct (as it's based directly on the
given information), m⌢BD = 2 * m∠BOD = 2(96°) = 192°.Thus, the correct answer should be: (D)
192 However, since 192 is not one of the options and our calculations seem to contradict the given
data, it's likely there's an error or oversight in the information provided.

Error Category: Textual Understanding Error
Error Reason: GPT-4V does not correctly understand the symbols and terminology in mathematics
or geometry. In this question, it incorrectly interprets m ⌢ AB = 104 as the measure of an inscribed
angle, when the correct interpretation should be the measure of an arc or a central angle. Therefore,
the angle represented in the question, ∠AOB, is 104 degrees, and ∠COD is 168 degrees. Since the
concept is confused right from the start, GPT4-V does not derive the correct answer in the
subsequent calculations. The key to the question is to determine the angle of BOD, which is equal to
the angle AOC by using the condition of parallel lines. Then, by subtracting the two given angles
from 360 degrees and dividing by two, we can obtain the correct answer.

GPT-4V: Given that the volume V of the cone-shaped cup is 36 𝜋 𝑖𝑛! when it's full, the formula for
the volume of a cone is:
     "                                                                "
𝐴 = ! 𝜋𝑟 # ℎ. From the given volume, we can set up the equation: ! 𝜋𝑟 # ℎ = 36𝜋. From which, 𝑟 # ℎ =
               "$%
108. (1) ℎ = & ! . Next, the surface area S of the cone (which does not include the base since it's a
cup) is given by: S = 𝜋𝑟𝑙. Where l is the slant height of the cone.
Using the Pythagoras theorem for the right triangle formed by the radius, height, and slant height
in the cone, we get: 𝑙 # = 𝑟 # + ℎ# . From which, 𝑙 = 𝑟 # + ℎ# . Now, substituting the value of h from
equation (1) into the equation for 𝑙, we get: 𝑙 = 𝑟 # +108# /𝑟 ' . Substituting this l value in S, we get:
S = 𝜋𝑟 𝑟 # +108# /𝑟 ' . To minimize the surface area, we differentiate S with respect to r and set it
equal to zero.
The differentiation and solving for r would be complex. Instead, we can substitute the given r and h
values from options (A) to (D) into the volume equation to see which one satisfies 𝑉 = 36𝜋 . The
option that satisfies this and also minimizes S would be our answer.

From options (A) and (D) which satisfy the volume, the surface area for each needs to be calculated:
                                                            #
(A) 𝑆 = 𝜋(3 2) (3 2)# +6# . (D) 𝑆 = 𝜋 2 3       2 3 + 6# .
Comparing the two surface areas, we can determine which one is minimal.
However, without doing the calculations, it's hard to definitively say which one is the minimal
surface area. For practical purposes, the answer could be either (A) or (D) based on the volume, and
one would need to compute the surface areas to confirm.

Error Category: Reasoning Error
Error Reason: The volume formula seems to be correct. The errors are made during the symbol
computation.

Question: Two coins rotate on a turntable. Coin B is twice as far from the axis as coin A.<image 1>
Option:
(A) The speed of A is twice that of B.
(B) The speed of A equals that of B.
(C) The speed of A is half that of B.




        <image 1>

GPT-4V: For objects rotating in a circle, the linear speed (v) is related to the angular speed (ω) by:
v=ωr. Where: v is the linear speed of the object, ω is the angular speed of the turntable (same for all
objects on the turntable), and r is the distance of the object from the axis of rotation. Given that coin
B is twice as far from the axis as coin A, let's denote the distance of coin A from the axis as r and the
distance of coin B from the axis as 2r.The speed of coin A is: vA=ωr. The speed of coin B is:
vB=ω(2r)=2ωr. Comparing the two speeds: vB=2vA. Thus, the speed of A is half that of B. The
correct answer is:(C) The speed of A is half that of B.

Ground Truth: (C) The speed of A is half that of B.

in the accompanying diagram. Which arrow best represents the direction of the light after leaving
the lens?
Option:
(A) arrow A
(B) arrow B
(C) arrow C
(D) arrow D
(E) arrow E




           <image 1>
GPT-4V: The given diagram depicts a converging lens (a double convex lens) and a parallel beam
of monochromatic light entering it. For a converging lens, parallel rays of light that are parallel to
the optic axis will be refracted in such a way that they will converge or meet at the focal point on
the other side of the lens. In the provided diagram, the ray is converging towards a point after
passing through the lens. Among the given options:
(A) arrow A
(B) arrow B
(C) arrow C
(D) arrow D
(E) arrow E
The direction that best represents where the light will converge after leaving the lens is (C) arrow C.

Error Category: Perceptual Error
Error Reason: GPT-4Vcorrectly identifies the theory behind the reflection of a converging lens.
However, when choosing the correct arrows in the diagram, it chooses arrow C instead of arrow E
that converging to the focal point. This is due the perceptual error of GPT-4V on the direction of
arrows, demonstrating the lacking ability in the sense of direction in the image.

Ground Truth: (E) arrow E
Explanation: A horizontal beam approaching a converging lens bends and converges through the
focal point

Option:
(A) Transient tachypnea of the newborn

(D) Meconium aspiration syndrome




       <image 1>
GPT-4V: Based on the image provided, which appears to be a chest X-ray, and the information that
the patient is a post-mature newborn, the most suggestive diagnosis is: (D) Meconium aspiration
syndrome. Post-mature newborns are at an increased risk of passing meconium (the baby's first
stool) into the amniotic fluid before birth or during labor. If the baby breathes the meconium-
stained amniotic fluid into their lungs, it can cause a blockage of the airways, leading to meconium
aspiration syndrome. The chest X-ray of a newborn with meconium aspiration syndrome might
show patchy or streaky areas on the lungs. However, it's important to consult with a pediatric
radiologist or neonatologist for a definitive diagnosis based on clinical findings and the entire
clinical picture.

Question: A 19-year-old man goes to his physician for a routine check-up. The physical
examination is normal except that his stool is positive for occult blood. A colonoscopy is performed
and there are over 100 lesions of the colonic mucosa and biopsy of one shows findings seen here
microscopically <image 1>. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Option:
(A) Hereditary non-polyposis colon carcinoma
(B) Hyperplastic polyps
(C) Ulcerative colitis
(D) Peutz-Jehgers syndrome
(E) Familial polyposis coli




           <image 1>

GPT-4V: The image provided appears to be a histological section of colonic mucosa. Given the
clinical scenario of a 19-year-old man with over 100 lesions of the colonic mucosa and the
histological findings provided, the most likely diagnosis is: (E) Familial polyposis coli. Familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP), also known as familial polyposis coli, is an autosomal dominant
inherited condition characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps in the
colon and rectum. If left untreated, there's a nearly 100% chance of developing colon cancer by
middle age.

Ground Truth: (E) Familial polyposis coli
Explanation: A. HNPCC has fewer polyps and the age of presentation is older. Mismatch repair
genes are involved. B. Hyperplastic polyps are small and few. They are just focal exaggerations of
the colonic mucosa. C. Ulcerative colitis leads to mucosal ulceration with residual islands of mucosa
called “pseudopolyps”. D. Peutz-Jehgers syndrome has the appearance of hamartomatous polyps in
the bowel, and they are not so numerous. E. The small polypoid circumscribed tubular adenoma on
a stalk seen here is benign, but persons with germline inheritance of the APC gene are at risk for
development of colonic adenocarcinoma by their teens or 20's.

Question: <image 1> This 79-year-old woman was driving her car when she had the sudden onset
of a severe headache. She pulled in to a service station and stopped the car. Then she slumped over
the wheel. She was taken to the emergency room, where she remained comatose and died hours
later. This gross appearance is found at autopsy. Which of the following is the most likely
diagnosis?
Option:
(A) Subdural hematoma
(B) Thromboembolization with cerebral infarction
(C) Multiple sclerosis
(D) Ruptured berry aneurysm
(E) Huntington disease




        <image 1>

GPT-4V: The image appears to show a brain with blood prominently spread around it. Given the
clinical scenario provided - a sudden severe headache followed by rapid unconsciousness and
death - the most consistent diagnosis with the presentation and gross appearance at autopsy is: (D)
Ruptured berry aneurysm. A ruptured berry aneurysm (also called a saccular aneurysm) can cause
a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which would present with sudden severe headache and can rapidly
lead to death if not treated. The hemorrhage can be seen as the spread of blood over the surface of
the brain in the image. The other options do not fit as closely with the clinical scenario and gross
appearance.

Question: A 41-year-old woman has noted a vaginal discharge persisting for 3 weeks. On pelvic
examination her ectocervix is erythematous. Cervical biopsies are taken and on microscopic
examination reveal the appearance seen here <image 1>. Which of the following is the most likely
diagnosis?
Option:
(A) Human papillomavirus infection
(B) Ingestion of chili peppers
(C) Diabetes mellitus
(D) Tuberculosis
(E) Chronic inflammation




             <image 1>

GPT-4V: The image provided appears to be a microscopic view of cervical tissue with a
characteristic appearance. The histopathological features seen here are suggestive of koilocytes,
which are squamous epithelial cells with a perinuclear clearing (halo) and irregular, raisin-like
nuclei. Koilocytes are a hallmark of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Based on the provided
image and clinical information, the most likely diagnosis is: (A) Human papillomavirus infection.

Error Category: Perceptual Error
Error Reason: GPT-4V incorrectly interprets the details of the image. The image contains “the
inflammatory cell population of mononuclear cells, mainly small round lymphocytes” and
“squamous metaplasia”, while GPT-4V identifies them as “koilocytes”.

Ground Truth: (E) Chronic inflammation
Explanation: A. HPV produces viral cytopathic effect such as koilocytotic change and atypical
changes in the squamous epithelial cells. It can drive the process to dysplasia and to carcinoma.
HPV by itself does not produce significant inflammation. B. The capsaicin in chili tends to irritate
nerve endings to produce the hot burning sensation, as a local effect in oral cavity. It is not systemic.
Capsaicin has been used to treat dyspareunia with vulvar vestibulitis, probably by affecting nerve-
ending mediated sensation, and there is no significant degree of inflammation. C. Diabetes mellitus
may increase the risk for infections, but by itself does not explain the inflammation seen here. D.
Tuberculosis of the genital tract is rare; mycobacterial infections tend to produce granulomatous
inflammation. E. This is a chronic inflammatory process, based upon the inflammatory cell
population of mononuclear cells, mainly small round lymphocytes. There is also some hemorrhage.
The squamous epithelium is normal, though if this were endocervix, it would represent squamous
metaplasia.

  Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of recurrent palpitations over the past 2
  months. He says that he was diagnosed with a minor heart defect during childhood but does not
  remember the details and has not had regular medical follow-up examinations since. Physical
  examination shows a heart murmur. Cardiac catheterization is performed, and hemodynamic results
  show <image 1>. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
  Option:
  (A) Mitral stenosis
  (B) Mitral regurgitation
  (C) Aortic value regurgitation
  (D) Aortic stenosis




                    <image 1>

  GPT-4V: Based on the provided hemodynamic results: The oxygen saturation of 75% in the right atrium,
  right ventricle, and pulmonary trunk, followed by a jump to 99% in the left atrium, left ventricle, and
  ascending aorta, suggests the presence of a left-to-right shunt, where oxygenated blood is mixing with
  deoxygenated blood. The pressure readings are also indicative. The normal pressure in the left atrium is
  usually around 10 mm Hg, while the pressure in the left ventricle during systole (contraction) can go up
  to 120 mm Hg or more and during diastole (relaxation) drops significantly. The given pressure for the
  left ventricle is 165/45 mm Hg, which is significantly high during systole. Meanwhile, the pressure in the
  ascending aorta is 155/70 mm Hg, which is closer to normal systolic pressure but has an elevated
  diastolic pressure. These findings indicate that blood is flowing back from the left ventricle to the left
  atrium during ventricular systole, which is consistent with mitral regurgitation. During mitral
  regurgitation, the mitral valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to flow backward in the heart. This
  can cause symptoms like palpitations and can be associated with a heart murmur on physical
  examination. Thus, the most likely diagnosis based on the provided data is: (B) Mitral regurgitation.

   Error Category: Lack of Knowledge
   Error Reason: GPT4-V successfully understands the question and the given table. However, due to
   the lack of specific knowledge about "This backflow decreases diastolic pressure in the aorta (N =
   60-90 mm Hg)" and "systolic pressure in both the ascending aorta...is increased", GPT4-V interprets
   "the pressure in the ascending aorta as 155/70 mm Hg, which is closer to normal systolic pressure
   but has an elevated diastolic pressure", and fails to identify the diagnosis of "aortic regurgitation".

  Ground Truth: (C) Aortic value regurgitation
  Explanation: Aortic valve regurgitation causes a backward flow from the aorta during diastole. This
  backflow decreases diastolic pressure in the aorta (N = 60-90 mm Hg) and increases diastolic pressure in
  the left ventricle (N = 5-12 mm Hg). This regurgitant blood combines with blood from the left atrium to
  fill the left ventricle, which results in an increased preload and a subsequent increase in stroke volume.
  As a result, the systolic pressure in both the ascending aorta (N = 90-140 mm Hg) and in the left ventricle
  (N = 90-140 mm Hg) is increased. Oxygen saturation and right heart pressures are normal in aortic
  regurgitation.

         GPT-4V: Based on the image provided, it's challenging to definitively determine the anatomic
         space occupied by the lesion without more context. However, the appearance and patterns shown
         resemble patterns often seen in subarachnoid hemorrhages or lesions.
         Therefore, the most likely answer is:
         (C) Subarachnoid space.

         Ground Truth: (B) Subdural space
         Explanation: The dura can be seen in the top right of the image. Organization into thin subdural

       Option:
       (A) This tumor is a classic epithelioid choroidal melanoma with necrosis
       (B) This may represent a retinoblastoma because of the classic pattern of necrosis and small round
       blue cells with rare pseudorosettes.
       (C) This tumor may represent the most common type of intraocular neoplasm, and requires further
       work-up to distinguish it from melanoma.
       (D) The patient has a good prognosis because the neoplasm was entirely removed and the margins
       are free of tumor.




               <image 1>
       GPT-4V: Based on the image provided and without the ability to perform further clinical or
       pathological tests, it's challenging to provide a definitive diagnosis. However, I can offer an analysis
       based on the image and the choices provided:
       (A) Choroidal melanoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the pigmented cells of the choroid,
       which is a part of the uveal tract of the eye. Epithelioid melanoma cells are large with abundant
       cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Necrosis may be present, and if the image shows large
       epithelioid cells with these features, then this choice could be considered.
       (B) Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the retina that predominantly affects children. It is
       characterized by small round blue cells, which can form pseudorosettes (rosettes that don't
       surround a lumen). If the image displays these features, then this could be a possibility.
       (C) Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. If the
       image shows features of melanoma but lacks the classic appearance of epithelioid melanoma or
       retinoblastoma, then further work-up would be necessary.
       (D) Making a prognosis solely based on an image can be challenging. Even if the tumor appears to
       be completely excised with clear margins in the image, other factors, such as tumor size, type,
       location, and potential metastasis, would play a role in determining the prognosis. Based on the
       image and the details provided, I cannot make a definitive choice. However, it's crucial to
       collaborate with a pathologist or an ocular oncologist for a comprehensive evaluation and
       diagnosis.

       Option:
       (A) QRS complex; ventricular depolarization
       (B) P wave; atrial depolarization
       (C) T wave; ventricular repolarization

       GPT-4V: The highlighted section of the ECG represents the: (A) QRS complex; ventricular
       depolarization.


       Error Category: Perceptual Error, Lack of Knowledge
       Error Reason: The error occurred because GPT-4V mistook the highlighted section for the QRS
       complex rather than the P wave. This confusion may have stemmed from two main factors: First,
       the model's attention may have been solely on the highlighted portion, whose pointed shape is
       characteristic of the QRS complex. Second, the model may have evaluated the entire
       electrocardiogram but misidentified the P wave due to its typically more rounded shape. A proper
       assessment of the whole electrocardiogram reveals that the QRS complex is actually represented by
       the taller spikes that come after the highlighted section, indicating that the highlighted area is,
       indeed, the P wave.


       Ground Truth: (B) P wave; atrial depolarization

Question: The antibiotic efrotomycin is produced by Streptomyces lactamdurans. S. lactamdurans
was grown in 40,000 liters of medium. The medium consisted of glucose, maltose, soybean oil,
(NH4)2SO4, NaCl, KH2PO4, and Na2HPO4. The culture was aerated and maintained at 28°C. The
following results were obtained from analyses of the culture medium during cell growth: <image
1>, <image 2> Is efrotomycin a primary or secondary metabolite?
Option:
(A) Primary
(B) Secondary
(C) None of them




          <image 1>                                 <image 2>

GPT-4V: To determine whether efrotomycin is a primary or secondary metabolite, we need to look
at the production pattern of the antibiotic in relation to the growth of the organism, S.
lactamdurans. A primary metabolite is typically produced during the active growth phase of the
organism, while a secondary metabolite is produced after the active growth phase, often during the
stationary phase or when nutrients in the medium become limited. From the provided graphs:
In the first image, we see that lipids (potentially representing cell biomass) increase and then
plateau. The oxygen consumption increases and starts to decline, which might indicate the end of
the active growth phase.
In the second image, glucose (a primary nutrient) is consumed rapidly during the initial phase of
growth. The "Log number of cells" (representing cell growth) increases rapidly and then plateaus,
indicating the end of the active growth phase. Efrotomycin production starts increasing after the log
phase of cell growth has plateaued.
Given these observations, efrotomycin starts to be produced after the active growth phase of the
organism, which is characteristic of secondary metabolites. So, the answer is: (B) secondary.

Ground Truth: (B) Secondary

      Question: The following synthetic scheme <image 1> has been used to synthesize raltegravir. If you
      wanted to create a number of analogues, which substituent <image 2> could be varied most
      efficiently using this synthesis?
      Option:
      (A) The type of substituent A on the aromatic ring
      (B) The type of alkyl substituent B present
      (C) The type of heterocyclic ring C present
      (D) The length of the chain D between the amide and the aromatic ring




                       <image 1>                                  <image 2>
      GPT-4V: Given the synthetic scheme provided, let's analyze each option:
      (A) The type of substituent A on the aromatic ring: In the second image, substituent A is located on
      the aromatic ring. Since this is present at the end of the molecule, it might be relatively easy to vary
      it, as it doesn't interfere with the rest of the synthesis.
      (B) The type of alkyl substituent B present: Substituent B is an alkyl group attached to the
      heterocyclic ring. Altering this substituent would require modifying the building block that is used
      to make this part of the molecule, which might be a bit more challenging.
      (C) The type of heterocyclic ring C present: The heterocyclic ring C appears to be a critical part of
      the structure and seems to be central to the synthesis. Modifying this ring would likely require
      significant changes to the entire synthesis.
      (D) The length of the chain D between the amide and the aromatic ring: Changing the length of
      chain D would require altering the length of the carbon chain in the precursor molecule. This
      change could be achieved by selecting different precursors with varied chain lengths.
      Thus, (A) The type of substituent A on the aromatic ring seems to be the most efficiently varied
      using this synthesis. The aromatic ring can be easily subjected to a variety of substitution reactions
      to achieve analogues with different substituents without disturbing the rest of the molecule.

      Error Category: Lack of Knowledge
      Error Reason: GPT-4V successfully understands the images and text. However, due to the lack of
      specific knowledge about "The synthesis is most efficient for creating analogues with a variety of
      heterocyclic rings", GPT-4V assumes "substituent A is located on the aromatic ring, which is at the
      end of the molecule, and it might be relatively easy to vary it, as it doesn't interfere with the rest of
      the synthesis" and subsequently makes an incorrect prediction.
      Ground Truth: (C) The type of heterocyclic ring C present
      Explanation: It is possible to use this synthesis to create analogues where all the positions indicated
      are modified as described. However, the synthesis is most efficient for creating analogues with a
      variety of heterocyclic rings. That is because the reaction sequence could be carried out on large
      scale to produce a supply of the penultimate structure. Analogues could then be created in one step
      by reacting this structure with different heterocyclic acid chlorides. If the synthetic scheme was
      used to create analogues at the other positions indicated, then more reactions will be needed. For
      example, varying the type of alkyl substituent present at position B would involve carrying out the
      complete synthesis for each analogue.

      Question: Each trace below <image 1> shows the change in mean arterial blood pressure from its
      baseline value. Which of the following drugs best fits the effects of unknown W?
      Option:
      (A) cocaine
      (B) phenelzine
      (C) phentolamine
      (D) propranolol




                   <image 1>

      GPT-4V: To answer this question, we need to understand how each drug affects mean arterial
      blood pressure in the context of Norepinephrine and Tyramine. Here's a breakdown:
      - Cocaine: Cocaine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine, which would cause a prolonged effect of
      norepinephrine, leading to a sustained increase in blood pressure. However, it wouldn't block the
      effects of Tyramine.
      - Phenelzine: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). MAOIs block the degradation
      of norepinephrine and also of indirectly acting sympathomimetics like Tyramine. When MAO is
      inhibited, administration of Tyramine can cause a hypertensive crisis because more of it is
      converted to norepinephrine.
      - Phentolamine: Phentolamine is a non-selective alpha-adrenergic antagonist. It would block the
      effects of both norepinephrine and Tyramine, leading to a decrease or no change in blood pressure.
      - Propranolol: Propranolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist. It would block the effects
      of norepinephrine on beta receptors but wouldn't have an effect on Tyramine's mechanism, which
      primarily acts through alpha receptors.
      Given the traces in the image: Before the administration of Unknown W, both Norepinephrine and
      Tyramine increase blood pressure. In the presence of Unknown W, Norepinephrine still increases
      blood pressure, but Tyramine no longer has this effect. The drug that fits this pattern is Phenelzine.
      In the presence of an MAOI, Norepinephrine would still exert its direct effect, but Tyramine, which
      typically induces the release of stored catecholamines, would result in an amplified effect due to the
      blocked degradation of norepinephrine. The lack of a hypertensive response to Tyramine in the
      second trace suggests that its conversion to norepinephrine might have been blocked, consistent
      with the action of an MAOI. Thus, the correct answer is: (B) phenelzine.

       Error Category: Lack of Knowledge
       Error Reason: GPT-4V lacks knowledge about the interaction between Cocaine and Tyramine.
       While it correctly recalls information about Phenelzine, it appears the lack of other plausible
       options leads to a reasoning error (which could be deemed as hallucination), as it strives to select
       the most plausible option from the ones given, and then justifies that selection. Therefore, the root
       cause remains a lack of knowledge.

       Ground Truth: (A) cocaine

    Question: In February 2014, the New England Journal of Medicine published in the same issue two
    epidemiological trials (field trials) of inactivated EV71 vaccine conducted by scholars in China
    respectively. One of the studies was from Jiangsu Province, China, and the study design was a
    randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (phase III trial), which included a
    total of 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months. The primary outcome indicator was the incidence
    of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day
    immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation
    of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the
    results were shown in the table below. <image 1>The incidence density(/1000 person years) of
    hand, foot and mouth disease in placebo group was

    Option:
    (A) 18.5

    (D) 21.8




                                           <image 1>

    GPT-4V: To find the incidence density (per 1000 person years) of hand, foot, and mouth disease in
    the placebo group, we need to calculate the rate of new cases of the disease per 1000 person years of
    observation. From the table:
    Number of new cases of EV71-related hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina in placebo
    group = 94Total person years observed for placebo group = 4873.0 person years. Incidence density =
    (Number of new cases / Total person years observed) x 1000Incidence density = (.0) x 1000 = 19.3.
    Therefore, the incidence density (/1000 person years) of hand, foot and mouth disease in placebo
    group is:(C) 19.3

    Error Category: Textual Understanding Error
    Error Reason: The question asked for the incidence density (/1000 person-years) of hand, foot, and
    mouth disease in the placebo group, which should have been correctly calculated as (90/4873 * 1000
    = 18.5). However, GPT-4 erroneously extracted the data for EV71-related hand, foot, and mouth
    disease or herpangina (94/4873 * 1000=19.3), leading to an incorrect final answer.

 Question: A maternal and child health facility wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of two methods
 of screening for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I-III), electronic colposcopy and cervical
 liquid-based cytology (TCT). 600 gynaecological outpatient cases were examined by both methods,
 and all cases were confirmed with cervical histopathology (the gold standard) at the same time. The
 results of all examinations were summarised in the table. <image 1>The false positive rate of the
 serial test was
 Option:
 (A) 0.95
 (B) 0.51
 (C) 0.75
 (D) 0.05




                                          <image 1>
 GPT-4V: To determine the false positive rate of the serial test (both electronic colposcopy and TCT
 positive) for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I-III), we can use the following
 formula: False Positive Rate (FPR) = False Positives / (False Positives + True Negatives) False
 Positives (FP): These are the cases where both tests are positive (+, +) but the patient does not
 actually have cervical lesions. From the table:
 Patients with non-cervical lesions and both tests positive = 25So, FP = 25True Negatives (TN): These
 are the cases where both tests are positive (+, +) and the patient actually has cervical lesions,
 combined with the cases where both tests are negative (-, -) but the patient does not have cervical
 lesions.
 From the table:
 Patients with cervical lesions and both tests positive = 70
 Patients with non-cervical lesions and both tests negative = 245So, TN = 70 + 245 = 315Now,
 plugging into the formula:
 FPR = FP / (FP + TN)
 FPR = 25 / (25 + 315)
 FPR = 0.0735 or 7.35%. The value closest to 7.35% is 0.075. So, the correct answer is:\n(C) 0.75

 Error Category: Lack of Knowledge
 Error Reason: The correct identification of False Positives (FP) was indeed 25, but there was a
 mistake in calculating True Negatives (TN). TNs are cases that are actually negative and also test
 negative. GPT-4 incorrectly used True Positives (TP) in calculating TN. Moreover, the question
 pertained to a series test, meaning a diagnosis of positive was made only if both electronic
 colposcopy and TCT (ThinPrep Cytologic Test) were positive. However, GPT-4 considered a
 positive diagnosis if either one of these tests was positive, which led to an error in the count of TN.
 The correct calculation should be 25/(10+220+25+245) = 0.05.

 Ground Truth: (D) 0.05

GPT-4V: The tables provide information on the origin of coins found in buried caches in different
regions and their approximate dates. This kind of information indicates where coins from different
regions and time periods ended up, which suggests patterns of trade or movement of goods,
services, and people. Given the options:(A) The diffusion of cultural traditions along Eurasian trade
routes: While the movement of coins can suggest trade routes and interactions between different
regions, it does not directly provide information about the diffusion of cultural traditions. (B) The
spread of technological innovations across regions in Eurasia: The tables do not specifically address
technological innovations. (C) The geographic extent of the monetization of Eurasian economies:
The presence of coins from various regions in different locations suggests areas where money was
being used in trade and therefore indicates the extent of monetization. (D) The extent to which
government economic policies in Eurasia in the period 600-1450 represented a continuity of earlier
policies: The tables show where coins from different periods were found, but they do not
specifically provide information on government policies or whether those policies represented
continuity. Given the information in the tables, the best answer would be:
(C) The geographic extent of the monetization of Eurasian economies.

Error Reason: GPT-4V wrongly interprets the image, because it doesn‘t correctly interpret the
contradiction between the comics on the top half and the bottom half. The perspective of the
cartoonist is that the United States has been a savior to the nations brought under its control, saving

Explanation: The perspective of the cartoonist is that the United States has been a savior to the
nations brought under its control, saving them from poverty or oppression and bringing them
trade, prosperity, and democratic governments. Although one might be tempted to cast the United
States in the role of imperialist (B), the purpose of the cartoon is to highlight the positive
transformation of the people due to their "rescue" by the United States, rather than the benefits to
the United States. Because the cartoon claims the people are better off for having been "rescued" by
the United States, the United States is not seen as an oppressor (A). Since isolationists do not

Question: For the person in <image 1>, what is the root of everything social?
Option:
(A) Collective Effervescence
(B) Society
(C) The Economy
(D) Religion




         <image 1>

GPT-4V: For Émile Durkheim, one of the founding figures in sociology, the root of everything
social could be argued to be "Collective Effervescence," a term he coined. This concept refers to the
moments of communal passion and ecstasy that occur during group rituals and events, which
Durkheim believed were the basis for the solidarity of social groups and ultimately for society itself.
It's a foundational element in his theory on the formation of religions and societies.
The correct answer to the question, considering Emile Durkheim's sociological theories, is
"Religion." Durkheim viewed religion as a fundamental social institution that is central to the
formation and sustenance of societies. He believed that religious beliefs and rituals play a critical
role in creating social cohesion and collective conscience.

Ground Truth: (D) Religion
Explanation: Durkheim believed that religion is the root of everything social. He argued that
religion provides the framework and moral values that bind individuals together and create social
cohesion. Through religious rituals and beliefs, people experience a sense of collective effervescence,
a heightened state of group solidarity and shared emotions. This collective effervescence reinforces
social norms, strengthens social bonds, and gives individuals a sense of belonging to a larger
community. Therefore, Durkheim viewed religion as the foundation of social order and the driving
force behind societal cohesion.

  Option:
  (A) Power
  (B) Master status
  (C) Family values
  (D) Wealth




          <image 1>

  GPT-4V: The diagram you provided outlines the concept of Symbolic Interactionism, which is a
  sociological perspective that focuses on the ways in which individuals interact and communicate
  through symbols. Given the choices provided and the context of Symbolic Interactionism, the most
  appropriate answer is: (B) Master status. Master status refers to a social position that is the primary
  identifying characteristic of an individual. It dominates other statuses and thereby determines a
  person's general position in society. In the context of crime, some symbolic interactionists might
  argue that an individual's master status (e.g., being labeled as a "criminal") could influence their
  interactions and how they are perceived by others in society.

  Error Category: Reasoning Error
  Error Reason: The answer Master status fails to find the root cause of conducting crimes.
  Essentially, an individual who grows up in a poor neighbourhood with high rates of drug use,
  violence, teenage delinquency, and deprived parenting is more likely to become a criminal than an
  individual from a wealthy neighbourhood with a good school system and families who are
  involved positively in the community. Therefore, the primary/core reason is wealth. The answer is
  D.

  Ground Truth: (D) Wealth

Question: Described by the psychologist B. F. Skinner, operant conditioning posits that learning
can be understood by the interaction between reinforcers and stimuli. Studies from both
comparative and human psychology have supported Skinner's initial findings and expanded upon
them. The following figure shows a hypothetical example of various operant conditioning trials.
During these trials, when a rat pressed a bar (as indicated by the hash mark on the graph), the
behavior was reinforced by the presentation of a food pellet. The reinforcement schedule differs in
each cell of the figure. Time is displayed on the x-axis and cumulative responses (bar presses) is
displayed on the y-axis. ([image 1]) Imagine that you are watching a rat complete one of the tasks in
the figure above. The rat is pressing the bar at a very high rate and takes a short break from
pressing the bar each time the food pellet is delivered. What type of reinforcement schedule are you
MOST likely watching?
Option:
(A) variable-interval
(B) variable-ratio
(C) fixed-interval
(D) fixed-ratio




                     <image 1>

GPT-4V: The graph corresponds to operant conditioning schedules. The pattern of high-rate bar
pressing and short breaks after reinforcement suggests a Fixed Ratio schedule, shown in the top left
quadrant. Here, reinforcement is given after a set number of responses, which is reflected in the
steep inclines followed by drops on the graph. The rat's behavior—rapid pressing until receiving a
pellet, then pausing—matches this schedule, indicating it understands that a specific number of
presses leads to a reward, thus causing the observed high response rate followed by a break.


Ground Truth: (D) fixed-ratio

 Question: Guided meditation and deep-breathing exercises have long been used as effective
 techniques for stress reduction. The mechanism of action for this non-pharmacologic intervention is
 not entirely known, but scientists believe that the act of focusing one’s thoughts and deep belly-
 breathing both serve to somehow inhibit the stress response activated by the hypothalamic-
 pituitary-adrenal axis. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that causes a range of
 abdominal discomfort and bowel irregularities, but unlike bowel diseases with similar symptoms,
 there are no physical abnormalities; rather, the disorder appears to be the physical manifestation of
 psychological triggers. The current standard non-pharmacologic treatment for IBS is cognitive
 behavior therapy (CBT). CBT treats IBS sufferers by treating the emotional and psychological
 triggers that cause physical symptoms. In an attempt to determine if meditation is as beneficial as
 CBT for treating IBS, a recent six-month study was conducted on female IBS sufferers. Eligible
 participants had active IBS symptoms for at least three months during the past year. Participants
 with and without a diagnosed anxiety disorder were recruited to participate in this study. Subjects
 were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a CBT group, a guided-meditation group, and a no-
 treatment group. Approximately 65% of the participants had an anxiety disorder, and these subjects
 were roughly equally represented in each of the three groups. The results of this study, measured
 by percent reduction of IBS symptoms after treatment, are summarized in Figure 1. <image 1>
 Based on the results of this study, what can be most reasonably concluded about the efficacy of CBT
 for IBS sufferers who do not have an anxiety disorder?
 Option:
 (A) CBT is more effective than no treatment and more effective than meditation.
 (B) CBT and meditation combined provide the most effective treatment possible.
 (C) CBT is not as effective as meditation.
 (D) CBT is equally effective for IBS sufferers with and without anxiety disorders.




               <image 1>

  GPT-4V: Based on Figure 1: For IBS sufferers without an anxiety disorder: CBT shows significant
  symptom reduction. Meditation shows some symptom reduction, but it's less than CBT. No
  treatment shows very minimal symptom reduction. Thus, for IBS sufferers who do not have an
  anxiety disorder, CBT is more effective than both meditation and no treatment. The answer is: (A)
  CBT is more effective than no treatment and more effective than meditation.

  Error Category: Perceptual Error
  Error Reason: Based on the description from GPT-4V: "For IBS sufferers without an anxiety
  disorder: CBT shows significant symptom reduction. Meditation shows some symptom reduction,
  but it's less than CBT. No treatment shows very minimal symptom reduction." It appears that GPT-
  4v misinterpreted the black bars in the plot as the "Non-Anxiety Disorder" group. However, the
  actual "Non-Anxiety Disorder" group is represented by the gray bars as shown in the legend.

  Ground Truth: (C) CBT is not as effective as meditation.

Question: An ein4 mutant never binds ethylene. In the presence of ethylene what phenotype will
be observed for the seedling triple response in this ein4 mutant?<image 1>
Option:
(A) Seedlings will become de-etiolated.
(B) Seedlings will grow towards the light.
(C) The ETR1 receptor will activate CTR1 and the seedling triple response.
(D) CTR1 will be activated and inhibit the seedling triple response.
(E) RAN1 will provide Cu2+ to the ethylene receptors.




               <image 1>
GPT-4V: The image shows a schematic representation of the ethylene signaling pathway in plants.
In a typical situation, when ethylene binds to its receptor (ETR1, ERS1, ERS2), it prevents the
receptor from activating CTR1, which in turn allows the downstream signaling pathway to proceed,
leading to the activation of EIN2, EIN3, and the ethylene response (seedling triple response).In the
case of the ein4 mutant, which cannot bind ethylene, the pathway from the ethylene receptor to the
downstream components would not be initiated. Since EIN4 is presumably an ethylene receptor
like ETR1 and the mutant form of EIN4 cannot bind ethylene, this means that the receptor cannot
turn off the CTR1, leading to the inhibition of the seedling triple response due to the constitutive
activation of CTR1.Therefore, the correct answer is:(D) CTR1 will be activated and inhibit the
seedling triple response. This is because in the ein4 mutant, ethylene cannot bind to EIN4 to inhibit
CTR1, thus CTR1 remains active and the signaling pathway is off, preventing the seedling triple
response.

Ground Truth: (D) CTR1 will be activated and inhibit the seedling triple response.

Option:
(A) Long pastern bone
(B) Coffin bone
(C) Short pastern
(D) Navicular bone, one bone per digit, located at the interphalangeal joint




            <image 1>
GPT-4V: The arrow in the image is pointing to the lower part of the horse's leg, specifically to the
bone known as the "short pastern" or the "second phalanx". This is the bone located between the
long pastern bone (first phalanx) and the coffin bone (third phalanx) in the anatomy of a horse's leg.
Therefore, the correct matching term for where the arrow points is: (C): "short pastern"

Error Category: Perceptual Error
Error Reason: GPT 4V give the incorrect interpretation of the visual content in the image. Despite
having the capability to "see" the image, the model incorrectly identified the part of the bone
indicated by the arrow as the short pastern bone when it is actually the long pastern bone. This
perceptual error could lead to subsequent reasoning errors because an incorrect initial
interpretation affects the entire reasoning process that leads to the conclusion. Since the model
initially misidentified the bone, all subsequent explanations and reasoning were built on this
incorrect basis.

Ground Truth: (A) Long pastern bone

GPT-4V: The layer indicated by the arrow in the image is the uppermost layer of the leaf and is
typically known for its protective qualities and prevention of water loss. The correct term for this
layer is:(D) waxy cuticle.

Error Category: Perceptual Error
Error Reason: GPT-4V recognized the importance of the uppermost layer's role in protection and
water loss prevention but failed to correctly identify the visual signals indicating that the arrow was
pointing to the guard cells, which are not the waxy cuticle. The reasoning process was flawed
because the model did not correctly link the visual information with the correct biological structure.

GPT-4V: The image shows symptoms that are consistent with (D) charcoal rot. This disease often
manifests as brown pitting on the stem and root and is favored by drought conditions.

Error Category: Perceptual Error
Error Reason: GPT 4V maybe solely relied on the text to make a judgment instead of synthesizing
the visual cues with the textual description provided in the question.          The text mentioned "a
brown pit" and conditions "favored by drought", which led the model to incorrectly infer the
disease as charcoal rot. However, based on the visual symptoms displayed in the image, the disease
aligns more closely with brown stem rot. This type of error highlights a shortfall in the model's
capability to use visual signals to identify and differentiate between similar plant diseases.

Ground Truth: (C) Brown stem rot

Question: Two consecutive photographs were taken with a camera of focal length 200 mm mounted
on an airplane flying at a height of 1500 m. The overlap was exactly 60% and the size of prints was
250 mm 250 mm. The flying height was same in case of both the exposures and the flight was
balanced so that there was no drift. The ground was flat and was 250 m above the mean sea level.
Determine the scale of the photograph and the length of the air base.<image 1>
Option:
(A) The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 62.5 m; Air base = 625 m
(B) The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 64.5 m; Air base = 625 m
(C) The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 66.5 m; Air base = 625 m
(D) The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 68.5 m; Air base = 625 m

250 mm, Ground height = 250 m, above mean sea level Overlap = 60%. To determine the scale of the
photograph and the length of the air base, we can use the following formulas: Photo Scale (S): 𝑆 =
𝑓/(𝐻 − ℎ) . Where: S = Photo Scale, f = Focal length, H = Flight height, h = Ground height. Air Base
(B): Given the overlap is 60%, it means that 40% of the length is new coverage. B = 0.4L Where: L =
Length of the photograph on the ground. First, let's determine the photo scale (S): 𝑆 = 𝑓/(𝐻 − ℎ),
𝑆 = 200𝑚𝑚/(1500𝑚 − 250𝑚), 𝑆 = 200/1250. S = 0.16mm/m. To convert this into cm and m:
𝑆 = 0.16𝑚𝑚/1𝑚×1𝑐𝑚/10𝑚𝑚, S = 0.016 cm/m. To find the ground equivalent for 1 cm in the
photograph: 1𝑐𝑚 𝑖𝑛 𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑡𝑜 = 1𝑚/0.016 = 62.5𝑚. So, the scale of the photograph is 1 cm = 62.5 m.
Next, to determine the air base (B): B = 0.4L Given the size of the prints is 250 mm (or 0.25 m), this
represents the length of the photo on the ground:
𝐿 = 0.25𝑚×62.5𝑚/𝑐𝑚 = 15.625𝑚, 𝐵 = 0.4×15.625𝑚 = 6.25𝑚, B = 625 m
Based on the calculations, the correct option is: (A) The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 62.5 m;
Air base = 625 m.

Ground Truth: (A) The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 62.5 m; Air base = 625 m

                        <image 1>
      GPT-4V: To determine the jam density using the Greenshields model, we‘ll employ a linear
      regression approach on the data provided. The Greenshields model relates speed (u) and density (k)
      using the equation: 𝑢 = 𝑢!"# − 𝑢!"# /𝑘$"! ×𝑘, where 𝑢!"# is the maximum speed (which occurs
      when density k is zero) and 𝑘$"! is the jam density. From this equation, we can derive a linear
      relationship: 𝑢 = 𝑢!"# − 𝑢!"# /𝑘$"! ×𝑘. If we rearrange the terms, it looks like: 𝑢 = −𝑢!"# /𝑘$"! ×
      𝑘 + 𝑢!"# .Here, the term −𝑢!"# /𝑘$"! is the slope of the line, and 𝑢!"# is the y-intercept. We'll now
      use the data provided to determine the slope and y-intercept using regression analysis, from which
      we can then derive 𝑘$"! . Let's compute the regression parameters: Given data points: Speed (u):
      14.2, 24.1, 30.3, 40.1, 50.6, 55.0; Density (k): 85, 70, 55, 41, 20, 15. Using regression analysis on this
      data, the equation of the line relating speed and density would be: u = mk + c, where m is the slope
      and c is the y-intercept. By comparing this to the Greenshields model equation, we can deduce: 𝑢 =

      above equation for m: 𝑘$"! = −𝑢!"# /𝑢. Once we determine the slope m using the regression
      analysis, we can solve for 𝑘$"! . For the purpose of this exercise, I will not be calculating the slope
      using the regression formula directly (as that would be computationally intensive), but based on the
      linear relationship implied by the data, the jam density 𝑘$"! would be slightly greater than the
      highest density value provided (85 veh/km). Using this logic, the closest option from the choices
      given is: kj = 110 \, veh/mi. Therefore, the answer would be: (A) kj = 110 veh/mi.

      Error Category: Reasoning Error
      Error Reason: The model correctly recalls the knowledge, but doesn't calculate it and directly gives
      the answer that it thinks is the closest one, which is incorrect.

Question: Suppose we run Dijkstra's single source shortest-path algorithm on the following edge
weighted directed graph with vertex P as the source. In what order do the nodes get included into
the set of vertices for which the shortest path distances are finalized?<image 1>
Option:
(A) P, Q, R, S, T, U
(B) P, Q, R, U, S, T
(C) P, Q, R, U, S, T
(D) P, Q, T, R, U, S




               <image 1>
GPT-4V: To determine the order in which the nodes are included using Dijkstra's algorithm, we
will start with vertex P and then repeatedly select the vertex with the smallest distance that hasn't
been included yet. Initialize distances: makefile Copy code P = 0, Q = ∞, R = ∞, S = ∞, T = ∞, U = ∞,
Begin with source vertex P:P to Q = 1P to S = 4P to T = 7Now, the smallest distance is for Q. So, Q is
the next vertex. For Q:P to Q to R = 2P to Q to S = 5 (But, P to S is 4, so this is not considered)P to Q
to T = 7 (Same as P to T, so this is not updated)Now, the smallest distance among the remaining
vertices is for R. So, R is the next vertex. For R:P to Q to R to U = 3P to Q to R to S = 4 (But, P to S is
already 4)Now, the smallest distance among the remaining vertices is for U. So, U is the next vertex.
For U:P to Q to R to U to S = 5 (But, P to S is already 4)The remaining vertices are S and T. Between
them, S has the smallest distance. So, S is the next vertex. For S:P to S to T = 6 (But, P to T is already
7 and P to Q to T is also 7)Now, only T remains. So, T is the last vertex. The final order is:, P, Q, R,
U, S, T. The correct option is:(B) P, Q, R, U, S, T.

Ground Truth: (B) P, Q, R, U, S, T

          Question: <image 1> shows a DFA. Is it minimal?

          Option:
          (A) Yes
          (B) No
          (C) Not sure




                             <image 1>

          GPT-4V: To determine whether a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) is minimal, we generally
          follow a process to minimize the DFA and see if it results in a DFA with fewer states than the
          original. However, without more details regarding the acceptance criteria for each state (like which
          states are accepting and which are not), we can‘t definitively determine minimality from the
          diagram alone. But, let’s try to infer some information from the given diagram: There‘s no
          unreachable state from the start state; every state can be reached. There’s no state with identical
          transitions for the given inputs which could suggest merging. However, one thing to note is that
          two states are equivalent (and can be merged) if they have the same transitions on every input to
          the same set of states, and they are either both accepting or both non-accepting. Without knowing
          which states are accepting, we can‘t definitively say if the DFA is minimal or not. Therefore, the
          answer is: (C) not sure.


          Error Category: Perceptual Error, Lack of Knowledge
          Error Reason: GPT-4V chooses the wrong answer of “not sure”, because it does not know “which
          states are accepting”. However, those states are denoted by a double circle. So, there might be two
          reasons why GPT-4V makes the mistake: (1) it made a perceptual error and failed to recognize the
          double circle or missed this important visual signal in the image; (2) it might have recognized there
          is a double circle in the graph, but failed to connect it with the concept of “accept state”, due to lack
          of specific subject knowledge. Apart from this, the model recalled relevant knowledge and applied
          it to derive most steps correctly.

   (D) None of the other answers




                               <image 1>
   GPT-4V: The image depicts a timeline representation of various transactions over time across two
   CPUs (CPU1 and CPU2). Interleaved processing occurs when two transactions are processed
   alternately, meaning that one starts, then the other starts before the first one finishes, and then the
   first one might resume, and so on. From the given image: Transaction A on CPU1 starts and finishes
   without being interleaved with any other transaction. Transaction B on CPU1 starts after A finishes
   and completes without being interleaved with any other transaction. Transaction A on CPU2 starts
   and finishes without any interleaving. Transaction B on CPU2 starts after A finishes and completes
   without being interleaved with any other transaction. Transaction C on CPU1 starts and finishes
   without any interleaving. Transaction D on CPU2 starts and finishes without any interleaving. So,
   based on the provided options: (A) A and B: These are sequential on both CPUs, not interleaved. (B)
   B and C: These are sequential, not interleaved. (C) C and D: These are on separate CPUs and are not
   interleaved with each other. (D) None of the other answers. The correct answer is: (D) None of the
   other answers.

   Error Category: Perceptual Error
   Error Reason: GPT-4V recalls the correct knowledge “Interleaved processing occurs when two
   transactions are processed alternately, meaning that one starts, then the other starts before the first
   one finishes, and then the first one might resume, and so on.” However, it fails to interpret the
   image w.r.t. transaction A and B: “Transaction A on CPU1 starts and finishes without being
   interleaved with any other transaction. Transaction B on CPU1 starts after A finishes and completes
   without being interleaved with any other transaction. Transaction A on CPU2 starts and finishes
   without any interleaving. Transaction B on CPU2 starts after A finishes and completes without
   being interleaved with any other transaction." The figure intends to illustrate transaction A and B
   being processed concurrently on one CPU in an interleaved fashion. These two processes have
   nothing to do with the CPU1 and CPU2 shown on the right side of the figure. On the perception
   level, the model made a wrong connection by saying the first appearance of transaction A is on
   CPU1 and the second appearance is on CPU2 (and the same for transaction B). With that said, the
   figure is indeed a non-trivial one to interpret and a model might need to know some subject-specific
   convention to interpret it correctly.

   Question: Is the one shown in above figure a minimal DFA? <image 1>
   Option:
   (A) Yes
   (B) No




          <image 1>
   GPT-4V: To determine if the given DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) is minimal, we need to
   check if there are any equivalent states that can be merged. Equivalent states are states from which
   for every input string, the automaton ends in either an accepting state or a non-accepting state for
   both states in question. The given DFA has 5 states labeled 0 through 4. To check for equivalent
   states: We start by marking pairs of states where one is an accepting state and the other is not. In
   this DFA, however, there's no indication of which states are accepting and which are not, so we'll
   assume all states are relevant for now. Next, for each pair of states (i, j), we check if for any input (a
   or b), the transitions δ(i, a) and δ(j, a), and δ(i, b) and δ(j, b) lead to the same state or already marked
   pair of states. If not, we mark the pair (i, j).In the given DFA:
            For state 0: δ(0, a) = 1 and δ(0, b) = 4                   For state 1: δ(1,a) = 2 and δ(1,b)=0
            For state 2: δ(2,a) = 3 and δ(2,b) = 0                     For state 3: δ(3, a) = 4 and δ(3, b) = 0
            For state 4: δ(4, a) = 3 and δ(4, b) = 1
   Upon inspection, it seems that: State 2 and State 4: Both move to state 3 on input 'a', but they differ
   on input 'b'. So, they are not equivalent. State 1 and State 3: Both move to state 0 on input 'b', but
   they differ on input 'a'. So, they are not equivalent. State 3 and State 4: Both move to state 0 on input
   'b', but they differ on input 'a'. So, they are not equivalent. No pairs of states seem to be equivalent
   in the given DFA. Therefore, the DFA appears to be minimal.

   Error Reason: δ(0, b) = 2 instead of 4, and δ(1, b) != 0. The model fails to ground on the image.

Question: The circuit shown in Fig 1 of <image 1> is in the steady state at t = 0- with the switch in
position 1. At t = 0, the switch is thrown to position 2. Use Laplace transforms to formulate an

Option:
(A) (3𝑠 + 15 + 3𝑉" # )/(𝑠 $ + 6𝑠 + 8)
(B) (3𝑠 + 18 + 3𝑉" # )/(𝑠 $ + 6𝑠 + 8)

(D) (3𝑠 + 18 + 3𝑉" # )/(𝑠 $ + 4𝑠 + 4)




                  <image 1>

GPT-4V: To find 𝑣! (𝑠)using Laplace transforms for the circuit, we'll follow these steps: 1. Find the
initial conditions. 2. Apply the Laplace transforms to the circuit. 3. Solve for 𝑣! (𝑠).
1. Initial Conditions
Since the circuit is in steady state at 𝑡 = 0% with the switch in position 1, the capacitor will behave
as an open circuit for DC voltage. Therefore, the voltage across the capacitor 𝑣& (0% ) is 8V (from the
voltage source).
2. Apply Laplace Transforms
When the switch is moved to position 2 at t = 0, the circuit can be analyzed in the s-domain. The
inductor's impedance in the s-domain is sL = sH. The capacitor's impedance in the s-domain is
1/𝑠𝐶 = 1/𝑠𝐹. From the circuit: Applying KVL to the left loop: 𝑉' 𝑠 − 𝑠𝐻 5 𝐼( 𝑠 − 8 = 0 ⟹ (𝑉' 𝑠 −
8)/𝑠𝐻. Where 𝐼( 𝑠 is the current flowing through the inductor. For the capacitor: 𝑣! 𝑠 = 8/𝑠
+ ∫ 𝐼$ 𝑠 𝑑𝑠. Where 𝐼$ 𝑠 is the current flowing through the capacitor. Since 𝑣& 0% = 8𝑉, the initial
condition in s-domain is 8/𝑠 . Applying KVL to the right loop: 𝑉! 𝑠 − 1 + 1/𝑠𝐹 5 𝐼$ 𝑠 = 0. Using
KCL at the node between the inductor, capacitor and resistor: 𝐼( 𝑠 = 𝐼$ 𝑠 + 𝑣! (𝑠)/1
3. Solve for 𝑣! (𝑠)
Substituting the equations derived above and solving for 𝑣! (𝑠) , we get: 𝑣! 𝑠 = (3𝑠 + 18 +
3𝑉" # )/(𝑠 $ + 6𝑠 + 8)
So, the correct answer is: (B) (3𝑠 + 18 + 3𝑉" # )/(𝑠 $ + 6𝑠 + 8)

 𝑉%! = 212∠ −30∘ 𝑉 ; 𝑍!$ = 10 + 𝑗0 Ω , 𝑍"$ = 10 + 𝑗10 Ω , 𝑍%$ = 0 − 𝑗20 Ω . Since it is a star (Y)
 connection, the line-to-neutral voltage for phase b is 𝑉"$ . And: 𝑉"$ = 𝑉"% − 𝑉%! . Given that: 𝑉"% =
 212∠ −150∘ 𝑉 , 𝑉%! = 212∠ −30∘ 𝑉 . Using the phasor method for subtraction: 𝑉"$ =
 212∠ −150∘ −212∠ −30∘ . For phasor addition or subtraction, it's easier to convert the phasors to
 rectangular form, perform the arithmetic, and then convert back to polar form. 𝑉"% =
 212 𝑐𝑜𝑠(−150∘ ) + 𝑗(212 𝑠𝑖𝑛(−150∘ )) , 𝑉%! = 212 𝑐𝑜𝑠(30∘ ) + 𝑗(212 𝑠𝑖𝑛(30∘ )) . Subtracting the two
 phasors: 𝑉"% = 𝑉"% 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 − 𝑉%! 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 + 𝑗(𝑉"% 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔 − 𝑉%! 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔). Once 𝑉"' is calculated in rectangular
 form, convert it to polar form to get its magnitude and angle.
 Now, using Ohm's Law for phase b:
                                         (        ( *!+$,-./0∠("# !$+10
                                  𝐼"$ = "# , 𝐼"$ = "#                   .
                                            )"#                 234523
 Again, convert 𝐼"$ to rectangular form and then back to polar form to get its magnitude and angle.
 In a Y-connected system, the line current is equal to the phase current for that phase: 𝐼"! " = 𝐼"$ .
 The magnitude of 𝐼"! " is equal to the magnitude of 𝐼"$ . To provide a numerical value, we would
 have to go through the above calculations. Would you like me to proceed with that?

                                <image 1>
GPT-4V: To fit the given values to a Power-law, we'll use the form:𝜇 = 𝐶(𝑇 + ), where C and k are
constants to be determined. We can take the logarithm of both sides to transform this equation to a
linear form: ln 𝜇 = ln 𝐶 + 𝑘𝑙𝑛(𝑇). Now, let's choose two points from the given data to solve for C
and k. Using the data points (T, 𝜇) = (200 K, 1.50E-5) and (400 K, 2.43E-5): For the first point:
ln(1.50E-5) = ln(C) + k \ln(200) (1). For the second point: ln(2.43E-5) = ln(C) + kln(400) (2).
Subtracting (1) from (2) to eliminate C, we get: ln ( 2.43E-5/1.50E-5)=kln2. From this, we can solve
for k. Once we have k, we can use either (1) or (2) to solve for C. After solving for k and C, we can
use these values to see which option (A, B, or C) fits the power-law. Let's calculate k and C. k
=ln(2.43E-5/1.50E-5)/ln2≈ ln1.62/ln2 ≈ 0.68. Plugging this value of k into (1): ln(1.50E-5) = lnC +
0.68ln200. Solving for C: C≈1.505E-5. The relation becomes: 𝜇!" ≈ 1.505𝐸 #$ − 5𝑇 , , where K ≈ 0.68.
From the options given, this matches with: (C) 𝜇!" ≈ 1.505𝐸 #$ − 5(𝑇 ° /200𝐾)&.*) . So, option (C) is
the correct choice.

    GPT-4V: Given the nature of this problem, we'll use the first law of thermodynamics for a closed

    transfer during the process, and 𝑊"# = Work done by the system during the process. From the given
    image, we can infer that the process is polytropic and is described by the equation: 𝑃𝑉 ! = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡.
    For a polytropic process involving an ideal gas: 𝑊"# = (𝑃# 𝑉# − 𝑃" 𝑉" )/(1 − 𝑛). Given: 𝑃" =100kPa,
    𝑉" = 0.2𝑚$ , 𝑇" = 10° 𝐶 , 𝑃# =700kPa, 𝑇# = 290° 𝐶 . To find 𝑉# , we use the polytropic relationship:
    𝑃" 𝑉"! /𝑃# = 𝑉#! . The value of n can be determined using the temperatures and the ideal gas law:
    𝑃" 𝑉" /𝑇" = 𝑃# 𝑉# /𝑇# . Once 𝑉# is known, the work 𝑊"# can be determined using the equation for
    polytropic work. The change in internal energy Δ𝑈 for an ideal gas like helium is only a function of
    temperature and can be determined using: Δ𝑈 = 𝑚𝐶& (𝑇# − 𝑇" ), where 𝐶& = Specific heat at constant
    volume for helium (approximately 3.12 kJ/kgAK), and m = Mass of the helium. Mass can be
    determined using the ideal gas law: 𝑚 = 𝑃" 𝑉" /𝑅𝑇" , where R is the specific gas constant for helium,
    approximately 2.0831 kJ/kgAK. Finally, using the first law of thermodynamics: 𝑄"# = Δ𝑈 + 𝑊"# =.
    The given options for 𝑄"# are in kJ, so we need to ensure that all values used in calculations are

    using the polytropic relationship, calculate the work 𝑊"# , determine the change in internal energy

GPT-4V: The reactivity of a metal is inversely related to its standard electrode potential. The metal
with the highest positive standard electrode potential will be the least reactive. From the provided
table:Au³⁺ + 3 e⁻ -> Au has a standard electrode potential of +1.420 V, Cu²⁺ + 2 e⁻ -> Cu has a
standard electrode potential of +0.340 V, Ni²⁺ + 2 e⁻ -> Ni has a standard electrode potential of
−0.250 V, Fe²⁺ + 2 e⁻ -> Fe has a standard electrode potential of −0.440 V, Na⁺ + e⁻ -> Na has a
standard electrode potential of −2.924 V. The highest positive standard electrode potential is for Au,
which is +1.420 V. So, the least reactive metal is: (A) Au.

Ground Truth: (A) Au
Explanation: Since Au has the most positive standard electrode potential, it is the least reactive
metal

   we can infer that the shear strain is considered in the context of the entire deformation. This means
   the shear strain at A and B would be due to the overall deformation of the rectangle into a

                  <image 1>
GPT-4V: To find the steady-state error for a unity feedback system, we can use the final value
theorem. The final value theorem states that: 𝑙𝑖𝑚-→/ 𝑒 𝑡 = 𝑙𝑖𝑚-→/ 𝑠𝐸(𝑠), where E(s) is the Laplace
transform of the error signal e(t). Given a system with unity feedback, the error signal in the
Laplace domain can be given by: E(s) = R(s) - C(s), where R(s) is the Laplace transform of the
reference input, and C(s) is the Laplace transform of the system's output. The closed-loop transfer
function for a unity feedback system is given by:𝑇 𝑠 = 𝐺(𝑠)/(1 + 𝐺(𝑠)). Given a step input r(t) =
25u(t), the Laplace transform is: 𝑅 𝑠 = 25/𝑠The system's output in the Laplace domain is:𝐶 𝑠 =
𝑇 𝑠 ×𝑅 𝑠 = 𝐺(𝑠)/(1 + 𝐺(𝑠))×25/𝑠. Thus, the error signal in the Laplace domain is: 𝐸 𝑠 = 25/𝑠 −
𝐺(𝑠)/(1 + 𝐺(𝑠))×25/𝑠 = 25/𝑠×[1 − 𝐺(𝑠)/(1 + 𝐺(𝑠))]To find the steady-state error, we apply the
final value theorem:lim𝑠× 𝐸(𝑠). Substitute E(s) from the above equation and evaluate the limit.
                      %→#
Given: 𝐺 𝑠 = 450 𝑠 + 8 𝑠 + 12 𝑠 + 15 /= [𝑠(𝑠 + 38)(𝑠 * + 2𝑠)(𝑠 + 15)]Using the formula 𝑒%% =
𝑙𝑖𝑚%→# 𝑠×25/𝑠×[1 − 𝐺(𝑠)/(1 + 𝐺(𝑠))]. Now, evaluate this limit to find the steady-state error. After
evaluating, the answer will be one of the given options. Let's compute the steady-state error: 𝑒%% =
25×𝑙𝑖𝑚%→# [1 − 𝐺(𝑠)/(1 + 𝐺(𝑠))] . Solve for 𝑒%% : Using the given G(s) in the expression and
computing the limit, you'll find that: 𝑒%% = 25× 1 − 1 = 0. So, the steady-state error for the test
input 25u(t) is: 𝑒%% = 0. Thus, the correct answer is: (A) 0.

      GPT-4V: Two spheres, each of mass 𝑚. The spheres slide down a smooth circular guide in a vertical
      plane. The problem involves two parts: calculating the common velocity 𝑣 of the spheres when they
      reach the horizontal dashed position; finding the normal force 𝑁 between sphere 1 and the
      supporting surface just before it reaches the bottom position A. Part 1: The potential energy lost by
      the spheres will be equal to their change in kinetic energy. Potential energy lost by each sphere =
       𝑚𝑔ℎ. For sphere 1:Height ℎ! = 𝑅. For sphere 2: Height ℎ" = 2𝑅Total potential energy lost: 𝑃𝐸#$#%& =
      𝑚𝑔ℎ! + 𝑚𝑔ℎ" = 𝑚𝑔𝑅 + 2𝑚𝑔𝑅 = 3𝑚𝑔𝑅. This potential energy is converted to kinetic energy for the
      two spheres: 𝑃𝐸#$#%& = 2×21𝑚𝑣 " = 2𝑔𝑅𝑣 = 2𝑔𝑅. Part 2: Calculating the normal force 𝑁 just before
      sphere 1 reaches the bottom position A, its centrifugal force will be 𝑚𝑣 " /𝑅. Considering forces in the
                                                    '( !

      2𝑔𝑅. 𝑁 = 1 + 2 𝑚𝑔𝑁 = 1 + 2 𝑚𝑔𝑁 = 1 + 2 𝑚𝑔. Since 2 2 is a little more than 1, 𝑁 will be
      slightly more than 2mg but less than 3mg. The only choice which matches this range is 2mg. The
      correct option is: (A) 𝑣 = 2𝑔𝑅, 𝑁 = 2𝑚𝑔; 𝑣 = 2𝑔𝑅, 𝑁 = 2𝑚𝑔.

      Error Category: Reasoning Error
      Error Reason: The GPT-4v reasoning for the first part is wrong, and the second part is also wrong.
      For the first part, the potential energy for the two spheres is simply 𝑚𝑔𝑅, while the GPT computed it
      as 3𝑚𝑔𝑅 (and that leads to the wrong answer). Given the correct potential energy 𝑚𝑔𝑅, using
                                                   !
      energy conservation, the kinetic energy 2𝑚𝑣 " = 𝑚𝑔𝑅, which implies the required velocity to be

        𝑔𝑅. For the second part, while GPT knows to use centrifugal force formula, the incorrect
      computation in velocity causes the computed result not to be in the options. GPT ends up with
                                                                                                     '( !
      approximating the closest option. Indeed, by Centripetal force formula, 𝑁 − 𝑚𝑔 =                )
                                                                                                          ,   and plug
      𝑣=    𝑔𝑅, we end up with 𝑁 = 2𝑚𝑔.

      clear the obstruction at B?
      Option:
      (A) Minimal 𝑣! = 18.014𝑚/𝑠

      GPT-4V: To solve this problem, we need to use the kinematic equations of motion for a projectile.
      Step 1: Determine the time it takes for the rock to fall a vertical distance of (26m−16m)=10m after
                                                                 "
      clearing the obstruction at B. Using the equation: 𝑠 = # 𝑔𝑡 # , where 𝑠 is the vertical displacement =
      10m, 𝑔 is the acceleration due to gravity = 9.81m/s, and the falling time ≈1.428s. Step 2: Determine
      the horizontal distance covered in this time. This is the distance from A to the point right before the
      obstruction at B. Given that the total horizontal distance is 40m, the distance from A to just before B
      is 40m. Step 3: Determine the time it takes for the rock to fall 26m from A. Using the equation: 𝑠 =
      "
        𝑔𝑡 # , where 𝑠 = 26m, we obtain 𝑡 ≈ 2.302s. Step 4: Using time from Step 3, determine the horizontal
      #
      distance the rock covers from A =40m. Step 5: Equating the expressions for 𝑢 from Step 2 and Step 4,
      Solving for width we get: width ≈ 17.469m. Plugging this into the equation from Step 2: 𝑢 ≈
      15.775m/s. But we made a mistake. When the rock just clears the obstruction, it doesn‘t have a
      vertical velocity of 0. In fact, its vertical velocity 𝑣 when it clears the obstruction at B is given by:
      𝑣 # = 𝑢# − 2𝑔𝑠𝑣 # = 𝑢# − 2𝑔𝑠, where 𝑠 = 10m. Plugging in 𝑢 ≈ 15.775m/s to obtain 𝑣 ≈ 24.014m/s.

      Error Category: Reasoning Error
      Error Reason: The first step of GPT-4v calculation is correct, where the time stay beyond point B
      vertically is 2ℎ/𝑔 = 1.428𝑠, 𝑔 is the acceleration due to gravity = 9.81m/s and ℎ=10m. the second
      step is also correct, which says the horizontal distance to pass point B is 40m. The third step is
      wrong as we don't care about the time it takes for the rock to fall 26m from A. Therefore, the
      sequential calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be 40m/1.428s is approximated as
      28.014m/s.

D. Subfields of Different Subjects
In this appendix, we show all the subfields of each subject in Table 12. MMMU has 183 subfields in total, covering 30
subjects.

E. Distributions of Image Types
In this section, we show the distribution of 30 different image types in the 11.5K MMMU questions. The distribution of
various image types is displayed in Figure 95. A horizontal bar chart was employed to visually represent the number of
samples in each image category. The figure shows that the MMMU dataset encompasses a diverse range of image types,
from Advertisements to Diagrams.

F. Results on Different Image Types
In this section, we report the performance of some selected models on 30 different image types in Table 13.

G. Few-shot Results
As existing models like OpenFlamingo and Otter support few-shot or in-context learning, we report their few-shot perfor-
mance using the dev set as the in-context learning examples.
   As shown in Table 14, OpenFlamingo shows a decrease in performance when moving from 0-shot to 1-shot and 3-shot
learning (from 0.263 to 0.256) and there is a slight increase when moving to 5-shot. Otter shows a consistent decline as more
shots are introduced, dropping to 0.276 in 1-shot and further down to 0.258 in 3-shot and 5-shot. This trend suggests that
existing open-source models’ few-shot learning ability is very weak. And it additionally shows that our data samples might
be too hard for these models to understand the underlying patterns or context.

H. Data Annotation Protocol
This document describes a comprehensive protocol for annotating a dataset comprising college-level multimodal questions
(i.e., questions that incorporate images).

H.1. Data Collection
Sources of Data: Data is primarily collected from free online resources, quizzes, textbooks, and other study materials.
When collecting questions, the annotators should strictly adhere to copyright and licensing regulations on the source sites.
Data from sources that prohibit copying or redistribution MUST be explicitly avoided. Besides, the annotators should try to
find diverse sources instead of collecting questions from a single source.
Types of Questions:
• Multiple-Choice Questions: Including standard multiple-choice questions and true/false questions. These are character-
  ized by a question followed by several answer choices, with only one correct option.
• Open-Ended Questions: Encompassing formats like factoid, fill-in-the-blank, calculation-based, and short descriptive
  responses. Avoid collecting questions that have very long answers.
Image Types: The annotators should find various types of images (e.g., diagrams, charts, photographs)

H.2. General Guidelines
• General Principles: Annotations must be accurate, consistent, and adhere to a high standard of academic rigor.
• Specific Instructions:
  – All questions must contain one or more images.
  – All questions should be written in English.
  – All questions should meet the college-level difficulty.
  – The question should not be ambiguous and can be answered with one of the given options or a short answer.
  – Clearly categorize each question as either multiple-choice or open-ended.
  – Annotate all fields, including the question, answer options for multiple-choice questions, the correct answer, image
    types, question difficulty, and explanation (if there exists).

H.3. Data Format and Structure
• JSON File Format: The structured JSON format will include fields for number, question type, question text, answer
  options (for multiple-choice), correct answer, question difficulty, and explanation (if there exists).
• Naming Conventions:
  – Each collected sample will be stored in a separate JSON file following a standard naming rule: subject {Number}.json
  – Image Files: image {QuesNum} {ImageNum}.png
• Interleaving Question with Images: The images should be inserted as a file path in the question/options/explanations.

H.4. Quality Control and Validation
• A secondary review team will rigorously vet annotations for quality and guideline adherence.
• Regular audits of random samples from the dataset will be conducted to ensure sustained quality and consistency.

H.5. Handling Ambiguities
Ambiguities or unclear data instances should be flagged for a detailed review process. These questions will be collaboratively
examined in team meetings to establish a standardized approach for annotation.

H.6. Ethical Considerations
• Copyright and Licensing: Strict adherence to copyright and licensing regulations is mandatory. Data from sources that
  prohibit copying or redistribution will be explicitly avoided.
• Data Privacy: Compliance with privacy laws and ethical standards in data handling is paramount. The annotators should
  avoid collecting questions that contain any private information.

H.7. Data Contamination Considerations
In the construction of benchmarks for evaluating foundation models, it is essential to consider the risk of data contamination.
To address this, annotators should be tasked with carefully selecting questions that go beyond straightforward queries with
easily accessible answers. Instead, the focus should be on questions whose answers are tucked away in less obvious locations,
such as in separate documents or hidden in the concluding sections of extensive textbooks. This approach is beneficial for
constructing benchmarks that truly test the model’s ability to comprehend and synthesize information from diverse and
challenging sources.
H.8. Example Questions
Detailed examples of annotated questions are provided in an appendix to serve as a reference for the annotators.
• Multiple-choice Questions: Figure 96 shows an example of a multiple-choice question.
• Open-ended Questions: Figure 97 shows an example of the open-ended question.
   Besides, the annotators are encouraged to collect questions that contain multiple images within a single example. This
type of question requires special attention to file naming so that each image can be correctly referenced. Figure 98 shows an
example of a multiple-image question along with its JSON representation.
