Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 3 (image classification on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and Imagenette+). (2025_APSRL.pdf, Abstract; 2025_APSRL.pdf, Section 4.1 Experimental setup)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 3 (the paper applies the method to CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and Imagenette+ separately; no joint multi-task single model across all datasets is described, so covering all dataset-specific classification tasks requires one trained model per dataset). (2025_APSRL.pdf, Abstract; 2025_APSRL.pdf, Section 4.1 Experimental setup)

$$
\boxed{
\frac{3\ \text{tasks}}{3\ \text{models}} = 1
}
