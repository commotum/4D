Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 2
- Action step localization in instructional videos (CrossTask). (p.5)
- Text-based video retrieval (video clip retrieval with natural language queries) evaluated on YouCook2, MSR-VTT, and LSMDC. (p.5)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1
- A single HowTo100M-trained text-video embedding is applied to step localization and to text-based video retrieval ("We apply our model trained only on HowTo100M..." and "We also evaluate our learned embedding on the task of video clip retrieval"). (p.5)

$$
\boxed{
\frac{2\ \text{tasks}}{1\ \text{model}} = 2
}
