                  Kinetic theory of driven granular fluids

                         by Moisés Garcı́a Chamorro



Granular matter under rapid flow conditions can be modeled as a granular gas,
namely, a gas of hard spheres dissipating part of their kinetic energy during binary
collisions (inelastic hard spheres, IHS). On the other hand, given that collisions
are inelastic one has to inject energy into the system to compensate for the inelas-
tic cooling and maintain it in rapid conditions. Although in real experiments the
external energy is supplied to the system by the boundaries, it is quite usual in
computer simulations to heat the system by the action of an external driving force
or thermostat. Despite thermostats have been widely employed in the past, their
influence on the dynamic properties of the system (for elastic and granular fluids)
is not yet completely understood. In this work, we determine the transport prop-
erties of driven granular systems by using two independent and complementary
routes, one of them being analytic (Chapman-Enskog method, BGK solution and
Grad’s moments method) and the other one being computational (Monte Carlo
simulations).

       to the theoretical predictions for Ts and ϕ(c0 ). The latter has been
       obtained by retaining the three first Sonine polynomials (see Eq.
       (3.47)) and evaluating a2 and a3 with Approximation II. Time is

Introduction to granular gases


1.1      Introduction

Granular matter is a vast and diverse family of materials with the common prop-
erty of being composed of a large number of macroscopic grains with very different
shapes and range of sizes [1]. This kind of material is quite commonplace in Na-
ture and industry in examples like cereals, salt, sand, etc., Their study is of great
interest in a wide variety of the industry and technology sectors as well as in dif-
ferent fields of fundamental and applied science such as biophysics, astrophysics,
fluid mechanics, statistical physics and even in optics applications.

    The knowledge of physical properties of granular matter has also great prac-
tical importance in Engineering for the design of many industrial processes such
as conveying, handling and storage. This is important because it might prevent
malfunctions of the devices due to phenomena of obstructions, irreversible stuck
of grains and potentially dramatic events such as the collapse of a silo. It is also
usual to deal with processes of separating or mixing several substances in the form
of powder for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical or chemical products.[2]

    Some authors estimate that, nowadays, granular matter is involved in more
than 50% of trade in the world [3]. Many of the products we daily use have been
made using granular matter in a stage of their fabrication process. In fact, granular
media are the second most used type of material in industry after water. Rough
estimates of the losses suffered in the world economy due to granular ignorance
amount to billions of dollars a year [1].

    But not only in Earth one can find this kind of material. Out of our planet,
granular matter also abounds in space in the form of dust and grains. This is
illustrated for instance by Martian dunes or astronomic-range features as plane-
tary rings, asteroids, comets clouds (as the Kuiper’s Belt and the Oort’s Cloud)
and interstellar dust that reaches vital importance for the proper functioning of
communication satellites, probes and man ships such as the International Space
Station [4, 5, 6, 7].

    On the other hand, although in nature one can find granular systems in vacuum
(as for instance the previous mentioned interstellar dust), in most cases of interest
granular particles are immersed in a fluid (air, water, etc.). This kind of mixtures
(granular suspensions) is widely used in many industrial processes, for instance,
in civil engineering works with concretes, asphalt, bitumen or in the chemical
industry in fuel or catalysts deployed in the form of grain to maximize the active
surfaces.

    Another interesting problem where granular theories are useful is the diffusion
of fluids through densely packed cobblestone and rocks that is vital for the indus-
try of natural combustibles and subterranean water finding.The comprehension
of the coupling between fluid and solid phase is essential in geological problems
as soil stability and water controls, surface modelling by soil erosion, sand dunes
movement and the dangerous ripples formation in the sand under shallow sea wa-
ter. Furthermore, understanding of the dynamics of many natural disasters such
as avalanches, landslides, mud flows, pyroclastic flows, etc. can be achieved by
means of models of granular media [8]. In particular, an important target of the
research in granular matter concerns the description and prediction of natural haz-
ards that the above events suppose to the human activities in order to avoid or
minimize their impact on lives and economy around the world [9].

    Apart from their industrial and geophysical applications, there exist many
important scientific reasons to study the laws underlying the behaviour of granular
materials. On the other hand, despite its practical importance our understanding
of granular media remains still incomplete. No theoretical framework is available
to describe the different phenomena observed in nature for granular flows.

    It is well-known that granular media can behave like a solid, liquid or a gas [10].
Grains can create static structures sustaining great stresses but they can also flow
Chapter 1. Introduction to granular gases                                               3

as liquids or even gases when strongly excited. In addition the three states can co-
exist in a single system. In spite of this, it is not so easy to accept that such flow can
be described by hydrodynamic equations [11, 12]. Notwithstanding, when the sys-
tem is externally driven (rapid flow regime), fluidized granular media may exhibit
most of the known hydrodynamic flows and instabilities such as Taylor-Couette
[13] and Couette-Fourier [14] flows, Bénard convection [15], etc. Furthermore,
they may present a complex rheology exhibiting different non-Newtonian features
as nonzero anisotropic normal stresses differences and non-linear relation between
the shear stress and the shear rate much like in other non-Newtonian materials.
The normal stress in these fluids is often anisotropic, like in other non-Newtonian
materials. In addition, they show features that do have not their counterpart in
ordinary fluids. For instance, in vertically vibrated shallow layers of grains stable
geyser-like excitations called oscillons can be observed [16].

    This intriguing behaviour intermediate between solid and fluid is a basic char-
acteristic of granular matter. Above certain density threshold the system becomes
a compact solid because of the dissipating character of grain interactions but if
the system is externaly excited or its density is decreased, then it can flow.

    For all these reasons, in the last years a vast bibliography on granular dynamics
has been reported [17, 18].



1.2      Granular Gases

Generally, we may differentiate the high and low density regimes in granular mat-
ter. The latter regime is essentially characterized by binary particle collisions
whereas the former presents multiparticle contacts. As a consequence, the theo-
retical modeling and mathematical treatment to obtain their physical properties
are quite different in each regime [18]. In this work we will focus on the binary col-
lision regime where the system is usually called a granular gas [19] whose physical
realization can be observed in rings of planets, small planets, suspended particles
in fluidized beds, aerosols, rapid granular flows, etc. [20].

    One of the fundamental properties of the grains in granular matter is the
inelastic character of their collisions. When two particles collide, part of their
kinetic energy is irreversibly transformed into internal degrees of freedom (tem-
perature rising of particles, plastic deformations, etc.). This provokes a persistent
Chapter 1. Introduction to granular gases                                           4

loss of mechanical energy in the whole system. Dissipative interactions between
particles in unforced granular gases is the reason for which these systems are inher-
ently out of equilibrium. Granular gases also reveal self-organized spatio-temporal
structures and instabilities. When a granular gas has no energy input, then it
become unstable to density perturbations and if they freely evolve, they will even-
tually collapse by a mechanism of clustering instabilities (which is increasingly
stronger with increasing inelasticity) that will destroy the homogeneity of the sys-
tem [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. This tendency to collapse into clusters occurs even for
initially prepared homogeneous mass distributions [24, 26, 27]. The clustering
instability can be easily understood from a qualitative argument. Fluctuations
of density in granular gases generate relatively denser domains where the rate of
collisions (proportional to the number density) is higher than in dilute domains
and hence the kinetic energy loss due to inelasticity increases in these regions.
As a result, the grains tend to move from dilute into dense domains driven by
the granular pressure difference between them thereby further increasing the den-
sity of the latter and giving rise to bigger and denser clusters. This mechanism
allows for the growing of the clusters which may further coagulate by coarsen-
ing with other into larger clusters [18] or collide thereby destroying each other
[24, 28, 29, 30]. The critical length scale for the onset of instability can be de-
termined via stability analysis of the linearized Navier-Stokes (NS) hydrodynamic
equations [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]

    In order to maintain the system in rapid flow conditions, it is neccesary to com-
pensate the loss of energy due to the inelastic dissipation with the introduction of
external non-conservative forces acting over the whole system. This is commonly
done either by driving through the boundaries, (e.g., shearing the system or vibrat-
ing its walls [25, 40, 41]) or alternatively by bulk driving (as in air-fluidized beds
[42]), gravity (as in a chute) or other techniques. On the other hand, this way of
supplying energy causes in most of the cases strong spatial gradients in the system.
To avoid the difficulties associated with non-homogeneous states, it is quite usual
in computer simulations to homogeneously heat the system by the action of an
external driving force [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]. Borrowing
a terminology often used in nonequilibrium molecular dynamics of ordinary fluids
[56], this type of external forces are usually called thermostats. Nevertheless, in
spite of its practical importance, the effect of the external driving force on the
dynamical properties of the system (such as the transport coefficients) is still not
completely understood [57, 58, 59]. In particular, recent computer simulations
Chapter 1. Introduction to granular gases                                          5

[54, 55] have obtained some transport coefficients by measuring the static and
dynamical structure factors for shear and longitudinal modes in a driven granular
fluid. Given that the expressions for the transport coefficients were not known in
this driven problem, the simulation data were compared with their corresponding
elastic system. Thus, it would be desirable to provide simulators with the appro-
priate theoretical tools to work when studying problems in granular fluids driven
by thermostats.

    When externally excited, a granular system can become sufficiently fluidized
so that the grain interactions are mostly nearly-instantaneous binary collisions and
a steady non-equilibrium state is achieved [18]. In this regime each grain moves
freely and independently instead of moving joined in clusters. Hence, the velocity
of each particle may be decomposed into a sum of the mean or bulk velocity of
the whole system and an apparently random component to describe the motion
of the particle relative to the mean flux, usually named peculiar velocity. Such
random motion resembles the thermal motion of atoms or molecules in ordinary
gases where the collision time is much smaller than the mean free time between
collisions. This analogy between granular and ordinary gases allows one to manage
with a kinetic-theory picture of such systems. In that context, the mean-square
value of the random velocites is commonly referred to as the granular temperature.
This term, first coined by Ogawa [60], has nothing to do with the usual thermal
temperature, which plays no role in the dynamics of granular flows, despite such
name.

    Under these conditions, kinetic theory together with numerical simulations
are the best tools to describe the behaviour and provide constitutive equations
for rapid and diluted granular flows which gives insight into the physical origin
of the transport properties. The analogy between granular and ordinary gases
was first introduced by Maxwell in 1859 to describe Saturn’s planetary rings [61]
and constitutes one of the most remarkable applications of the kinetic theory of
granular media. Thus, from the point of view of kinetic theory, the study of
granular gases is an interesting and fundamental challenge since it involves the
generalization of classical kinetic equations (such as the Boltzmann, Enskog or
Boltzmann-Lorentz equations, for instance) to dissipative dynamics.

    On the other hand, driven granular gases can be seen as a prototype model
of a suspension of solid grains inmersed in a fluid in the dilute limit [62]. In
those cases, the stress due to the grains exceeds that due to the fluid (the ratio of
Chapter 1. Introduction to granular gases                                            6

the two is known as the Bagnold number), so that the effects of the fluid can be
ignored [63]. This condition is accomplished for example in aerosols or suspensions
in wich the gravity is balanced with bouyancy [64, 65, 66]. In these systems, the
influence of the interstitial fluid on the dynamic properties of the solid phase
is neglected in most theoretical and computational works. On the other hand,
the effects of the interstitial fluid turns out to be significant for a wide range of
practical applications and physical phenomena like for instance species segregation
[67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76] or in biophysics where active matter may
be considered as a driven granular suspension [77]. For this reason, the study of
gas-solid flows has atracted the attention of engineering and physicist communities
in the last few years [78].

    The description of gas-solid suspensions, whose dynamics is very complex, is a
long-standing branch of classical fluid mechanics [79]. For instance, particles sus-
pended in a fluid feel a lubrication force, transmitted by the surrounding fluid but
originated by the presence of another nearby particle. It is known that this kind of
interaction (usually called hydrodynamic interaction) depends also on the global
configuration of the set of grains [80], giving rise to tensor-rank force equations.
The modeling of these lubrication forces is rather involved and several approaches
can be used. For this reason, there is a large bibliography that extends for decades
and that is devoted to the study of this kind of interactions (Stokesian or Stokes
dynamics) [80, 81, 82].

    Nevertheless, in the dilute suspension limit, these hydrodynamic interactions
become less relevant [79, 80] and only the isolated body resistance is retained,
usually in the form of a simple drag force. On the other hand, due to the inher-
ent complexity of the interaction between the interstitial fluid and the granular
particles, early kinetic theory studies have neglected in most cases the effect of in-
elasticity in suspended particle collisions [83, 84, 85, 86, 87]. This kind of approach
is not entirely accurate since of course in most real cases the sizes of suspended
particles are big enough to render particle collisions inelastic (bigger than 1 µm,
otherwise particles may be considered as colloids, for which collisions are elas-
tic [82, 88]). Inelasticity in the collisions can play a major role in the dynamics
of granular (as opposed to colloidal) suspensions, specially in the dilute limit at
high Stokes number, where grain-grain collisions effects dominate over many par-
ticle hydrodynamic interactions [89]. However, only more recent works have dealt
Chapter 1. Introduction to granular gases                                           7

with inelastic collisions in the case of dilute [90, 91] and moderately dense [92]
suspensions.

    Despite the apparent similarity between granular and molecular gases, there
are, however, fundamental differences to take into account. The first one is related
with the size of the grains in a granular gas. Due to the macroscopic dimensions
of the granular particles, the typical number of them in laboratory conditions
is much smaller than Avogadro’s number and hence, the fluctuations of their
hydrodynamic fields are much bigger than in molecular gases [11]. However, their
number is sufficiently large to admit a statistical description.

    Granular gases present, nevertheless, a deeper difference with molecular gases.
This difference comes from the inelastic character of collisions, which gives rise
to a loss of kinetic energy. Thus, in order to keep the granular gas in rapid flow
conditions, energy must be externally injected into the system to compensate for
the energy dissipated by collisions. Therefore, granular matter can be considered
as a good example of a system that inherently is a non-equilibrium state.

    Apart from the collisional cooling, there is another fundamental open question
in granular gases: the posible lack of separation between microscopic and macro-
scopic length or time scales. To apply a continuum hydrodynamic approach it is
necessary that there exists a clear separation between macroscopic and microscopic
scales, that is, spatial variations of hydrodynamic fields must occur on a length
scale larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules. Correspondingly, the
typical macroscopic time scale should be larger than the mean free time between
two collisions.

    However, several authors claim that the above scale separation does not exist
for finite dissipation [11, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97] and the granular hydrodynamic descrip-
tion only applies in the quasi-elastic limit. The reason for this concern resides in
the fact that the inverse of the cooling rate (which measures the rate of energy loss
due to collisional dissipation) introduces a new time scale not present for elastic
collisions. The variation of the (granular) temperature T over this new time scale
is faster than over the usual hydrodynamic time scale and hence, as inelasticity
increases, it could be possible that T were not considered a slow variable as in the
usual hydrodynamic description.

    Despite the above difficulties, in recent years it has been proved that it is
possible to apply a hydrodynamic description for the study of granular gases. The
Chapter 1. Introduction to granular gases                                            8

main condition for a flow to be considered as a candidate for a hydrodynamic
description is a state of continual collisions. This implies that all particles within
each small cell are moving randomly relative to the mean flow velocity of the cell
[98].

    Nevertheless, the ranges of interest of the physics of granular gases fall fre-
quently beyond Newtonian hydrodynamics since the strength of the spatial gradi-
ents is large in most situations of practical interest (for example, in steady states).
This is essentially due to the balance between viscous heating and collisional cool-
ing and usually moderately large spatial gradients can appear [18, 99, 100]. As
said before, in these steady states, a hydrodynamic description is still valid but
with complex constitutive equations [101, 102].



1.3      Structure of the Thesis

We have organized this thesis as follows.

    In Chapter 2 we present the details of the model for driven granular gases
previously explained as a paradigm of dilute gas-solid suspensions. In addition,
we display the general mathematical and numerical tools to be employed in the
present work.

    Homogeneous steady states of a driven granular fluid are analyzed in Chapter
3. After a transient regime, the gas reaches a steady state characterized by a scaled
distribution function ϕ that does not only depend on the dimensionless velocity
c ≡ v/v0 (v0 being the thermal velocity) but also on the dimensionless driving
force parameters characterizing the external driving forces. The dependence of ϕ
and its first relevant velocity moments a2 and a3 (which measure non-Gaussian
properties of ϕ) on both the coefficient of restitution α and the driving parameters
is widely investigated by means of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
method. In addition, approximate forms for a2 and a3 are also derived from an
expansion of ϕ in Sonine polynomials. The theoretical expressions of the above
Sonine coefficients agree well with simulation data, even for quite small values of
α. Moreover, the third order expansion of the distribution function makes a signif-
icant accuracy improvement for larger velocities and inelasticities over theoretical
predictions made by considering only the second order expansion. Results also
Chapter 1. Introduction to granular gases                                           9

show that the non-Gaussian corrections to the distribution function ϕ are smaller
than those observed for undriven granular gases.

    The aim of Chapter 4 is to determine the NS transport coefficients of a dense
driven granular gas of inelastic hard spheres in the framework of the Enskog ki-
netic equation. Like in the undriven case [103, 104], the transport coefficients
are obtained by solving the Enskog equation by means of the Chapman-Enskog
(CE) expansion [105] around a certain reference state f (0) (zeroth-order approxi-
mation). While in the undriven case the distribution f (0) is chosen to be the local
version of the Homogeneous Cooling State (HCS), there is some flexibility in the
choice of f (0) for a driven gas. For simplicity, one possibility is to take a local
thermostat such that the distribution f (0) is still stationary at any point of the
system. This was the choice assumed in previous works [106, 107] to compute the
transport coefficients of a heated granular gas. On the other hand, for general
small deviations from the steady reference state, the zeroth-order distribution f (0)
is not in general a stationary distribution since the collisional cooling cannot be
compensated locally by the heat injected by the driving force. This fact introduces
additional difficulties not present in previous studies [106, 107]. In this Chapter,
we will adopt this point of view and will consider this kind of thermostat that
seems to be closer to the one used in computer simulations.

    The determination of the transport coefficients involves, like in the undriven
case [31, 108], the evaluation of certain collision integrals that cannot be exactly
computed due to the complex mathematical structure of the (linearized) Enskog
collision operator for Inelastic Hard Spheres (IHS). Thus, in order to obtain explicit
expressions for the above coefficients one has to consider additional approxima-
tions. In Chapter 5 we propose a possible way of circumventing these technical
difficulties inherent to IHS, by considering instead the so-called Inelastic Maxwell
Models (IMM) for dilute granular gases. As for ordinary gases, the collision rate for
these models is independent of the relative velocity of the two colliding particles.
In the case of elastic collisions (conventional molecular gases), Maxwell models are
characterized by a repulsive potential that (in three dimensions) is proportional
to the inverse fourth power of distance between particles. On the other hand, for
inelastic collisions, Maxwell models can be introduced in the framework of the
Boltzmann equation at the level of the cross section, without any reference to a
specific interaction potential [109]. In addition, apart from its academic interest,
it is worthwhile remarking that experiments [110] for magnetic grains with dipolar
Chapter 1. Introduction to granular gases                                          10

interactions are well described by IMM. Therefore, the motivation of the Chapter
is twofold. On the one hand, the knowledge of the first collisional moments for
IMM allows one to re-examine the problem studied in the previous Chapter in the
context of the (inelastic) Boltzmann equation and without taking any additional
and sometimes uncontrolled approximations. On the other hand, the comparison
between the results obtained from IMM with those derived from IHS [111, 112] can
be used again as a test to assess the reliability of IMM as a prototype model for
characterizing real granular flows. Previous comparisons have shown a mild quali-
tative agreement in the freely cooling case [113, 114] while the agreement between
IMM and IHS significantly increases for low order velocity moments in the case of
driven states (for instance, the simple shear flow problem) [18, 115, 116]. The main
advantage of using IMM instead of IHS is that a velocity moment of order k of the
Boltzmann collision operator only involves moments of order less than or equal to
k. This allows to evaluate the Boltzmann collision moments without the explicit
knowledge of the distribution function [117]. This property opens up the search of
exact solutions to the Boltzmann equation and justifies the interest of physicists
and mathematicians in IMM in the last few years [118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124,
125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141].
Thus, in this Chapter, we determine in the steady state the exact forms of the
shear viscosity η, the thermal conductivity κ and the transport coefficient µ (that
relates the heat flux with the density gradient) as a function of the coefficient of
restitution α and the thermostat forces. As for IHS [111], the expressions of η, κ
and µ are obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation for IMM up to first order
in the spatial gradients by means of the CE expansion [105].

    In Chapter 6 we study a steady laminar shear flow with null heat flux, usually
called Uniform Shear Flow (USF), in a gas-solid suspension at low density. The
solid particles are modeled as a gas of smooth hard spheres with inelastic collisions
while the influence of the surrounding interstitial fluid on the dynamics of grains is
modeled by means of a volume drag force, in the context of a rheological model for
suspensions. The model is solved by means of three different but complementary
routes, two of them being theoretical (Grad’s moment method applied to the
corresponding Boltzmann equation [142] and an exact solution of a kinetic model
adapted to granular suspensions [143]) and the other being computational (Monte
Carlo simulations of the Boltzmann equation [144]). Unlike in previous studies on
granular sheared suspensions [87, 92], the collisional moment associated with the
momentum transfer is determined in Grad’s solution by including all the quadratic
Chapter 1. Introduction to granular gases                                           11

terms in the stress tensor. This theoretical enhancement allows us for the detection
and evaluation of the normal stress differences in the plane normal to the laminar
flow. In addition, the exact solution of the kinetic model gives the explicit form of
the velocity moments of the velocity distribution function. Comparison between
our theoretical and numerical results shows in general a good agreement for the
non-Newtonian rheological properties, the kurtosis (fourth velocity moment of
the distribution function) and the velocity distribution of the kinetic model for
quite strong inelasticity and not too large values of the (scaled) friction coefficient
characterizing the viscous drag force. This shows the accuracy of our analytical
results that allows us to describe in detail the flow dynamics of the granular sheared
suspension.

Kinetic Theory of driven granular
gases


2.1     Introduction

In this Chapter we describe in detail the model of driven granular gases studied
in this work and the theoretical background and numerical tools that will be used
throughout the next Chapters.

    As discussed previously, granular matter in rapid flow regime obeys a hydro-
dynamic description that is different, and more general, than the hydrodynamics
of ordinary gases. This is due to the absence of energy conservation which in-
troduces modifications in the kinetic and its corresponding momentum balance
equations. The energy loss in the inelastic collisions makes neccesary the intro-
duction of externals forces in order to avoid instabilities and keep the system in
rapid flow conditions. Thus, as we said before, granular gases may be regarded as
prototypes of non-equilibrium systems and kinetic theory is an appropriate tool
to study their properties [145].

    Kinetic Theory is based on the assumption that the macroscopic properties
of a collection of gas molecules can be obtained from the one-particle velocity
distribution function f (r, v, t), where r and v are the position and velocity of
one particle, respectively. In other words, f (r, v, t) provides all of the relevant
information about the state of the system. The distribution function f (r, v, t) is


                                        13
Chapter 2. Kinetic Theory of driven granular gases                                14

defined as the average number of particles having velocity between v and v + dv
in a volume dr centered at point r in the instant t.



2.2      The model for Driven Granular Gases

We consider a system of smooth inelastic hard spheres (or disks) in d dimensions
(d = 2 for disks and d = 3 for spheres) with mass m and diameter σ driven by ex-
ternal non-conservative forces that act homogeneously over the system. We assume
in this work that inelastic collisions are characterized by a constant coefficient of
normal restitution 0 < α < 1, where α = 1 corresponds to elastic collisions, and
α = 0 to completely inelastic collisions (all the kinetic energy contained in the
velocity components in the direction of contact line at collision is lost).

    Although at moderate densities correlations between the velocities of two par-
ticles that are about to collide could not be negligible [146, 147], in this work we
have still assumed the molecular chaos hypothesis [148] and therefore the two-
body distribution function can be factorized into the product of the one-particle
velocity distribution functions f (r, v, t).

    As a result of the action of the external volume forces, the system reaches a
non-equilibrium stationary fluidized state. We can model the forces Fth (t) that
the surrounding fluid exerts on the granular gas. Thus, the equation of motion for
a particle i with velocity vi can be written as [50, 51, 52, 54, 55]

                                 mv̇i = Fth       coll
                                         i (t) + Fi ,                           (2.1)

where Fth                                                                 coll
       i (t) stands for the forces coming from the surrounding fluid and Fi    is
the force due to inelastic collisions.

    We will model Fth
                   i as a force composed by two different terms: (i) a stochastic
force where the particles are randomly kicked between collisions [149] and (ii) a
viscous drag force which mimics the interaction of the particles with an effective
viscous bath at temperature Tb . Under the above conditions one can consider the
following generalized Langevin model for the instantaneous acceleration of a grain:

    The first term Fst
                    i (t) attempts to simulate the kinetic energy gain due to
eventual collisions with the rapidly moving particles of the surrounding fluid. This
effect is specially important for small granular particles. The additional velocity is
drafted from a Maxwellian distribution with a characteristic variance determined
by the noise intensity ξb2 [149]. The stochastic force is assumed to have the form
of a Gaussian white noise and satisfies the conditions [150]:

                                           st 0                       0

where 1 is the d × d unit matrix and δij is the Kronecker delta function. Here the
subindexes i and j refer to particles i and j, respectively.

    For homogeneous states the drag force Fdrag
                                           i    (t) is proportional to the instan-
taneous particle velocity vi . The generalization of Fdrag
                                                      i    (t) to non-homogeneous
situations is a matter of choice. Here, since our model attempts to incorporate
the effect of the interstitial viscous fluid into the dynamics of grains, we define
Fdrag
 i    (t) as
                                Fdrag
                                 i    = −γb (Vi + ∆U) ,                            (2.4)

where γb is a drag or friction coefficient, Vi = vi − U is the particle fluctuation or
peculiar velocity, ∆U = U − Ug is the difference between the mean velocity of the
interstitial gas Ug (assumed to be a known quantity of the model) and the mean
flow velocity of grains U defined by
                                              Z

    This kind of thermostat composed by two different forces has been widely
employed in the regime of Stokesian dynamics for which the many-body hydrody-
namic forces are weak. Moreover, a similar external driving force to that of Eq.
(2.2) has been recently proposed to model the effect of the interstitial fluid on
grains in monodisperse gas-solid suspensions [62].

    The corresponding term in the Enskog kinetic equation associated with the
stochastic forces is represented by the Fokker-Plank operator − 12 ξb2 ∂ 2 /∂v 2 [151].
Chapter 2. Kinetic Theory of driven granular gases                                     16

    For moderately dense gases, the Enskog kinetic equation for the one-particle
velocity distribution function f (r, v, t) adapted to dissipative collisions reads [62]:

                         γb ∂       γb     ∂    1 ∂2

    In Eq. (2.7) g12 = v1 − v2 is the relative velocity of two colliding particles, Θ is

at contact as a functional of the nonequilibrium density field defined by

                                 n(r, t) ≡           dvf (r, v, t).                  (2.8)

The quantity χ accounts for the increase of the collision frequency due to excluded
volume effects by the finite size of particles. For spheres (d = 3), we consider the
Carnahan-Starling [152] approximation for χ given by

                                              1 − 21 φ
                                      χ(φ) =           .                             (2.9)
                                             (1 − φ)3

In the case of disks (d = 2), χ is approximately given by [153]

                                                          7

                                      χ(φ) =                  .                     (2.10)

In Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10), φ is the solid volume fraction. For a d-dimensional system
it is defined as
                                                 π d/2
                                     φ=                    nσ d .                  (2.11)

       Notice that the introduction of the two thermostat terms in the kinetic equa-
tion involves the emergence of two new and independent time scales given by
τst = v02 /ξb2 and τdrag = m/γb , respectively.

       For uniform states, the collision operator (2.7) is identical to the Boltzmann
collision operator for a low-density gas except for the presence of the factor χ, i.e.
JE [v1 |f, f )] = χJ[v1 |f, f )] where
                          Z         Z
J[v1 |f, f )] = σ   d−1

In the dilute limit (φ → 0) the size of the particles is negligible compared with the
mean free path ` and then χ → 1. In this case there are no collisional contributions
to the fluxes. It is important to recall that the assumption of molecular chaos
is maintained in the Enskog equation. This means that the two-body function
factorizes into the product of one-particle distribution functions [143, 148].

       The primes in Eq.(2.7) denote the the initial values of velocities v10 , v20 that
lead to v1 , v2 following binary collisions:

                                0           1
                               v1,2 = v1,2 ∓ (1 + α−1 )(b

                                                                 σ.                              (2.13)

       The macroscopic balance equations for the system are obtained by multiplying
the Enskog equation (2.6) by {1, mv, 21 mv 2 } and integrating over velocity. After
some algebra one gets [103, 151]

The cooling rate is proportional to 1 − α2 and characterizes the rate of energy
dissipated due to collisions [102]. The pressure tensor P(r, t) and the heat flux
q(r, t) have both kinetic and collisional transfer contributions, P = Pk + Pc and
q = qk + qc . The kinetic contributions are given by

    Let us point out that the macroscopic equations for a granular suspension (or
a driven granular gas), given by (2.14)–(2.16) have three additional terms respect
to the freely cooling granular gas [103] by the inclusion of three terms arising from
the action of the surrounding fluid on the dynamic of grains. The term on the right
hand side of Eq. (2.15) gives the mean drag force between the two phases (fluid
and solid). The other two are included in the granular energy balance equation
Chapter 2. Kinetic Theory of driven granular gases                                      19

(2.16).

    The model (2.6) can be seen as the Fokker-Planck model studied previously
by Hayakawa for homogeneous systems [154] but with γb and ξb2 related by ξb2 =
2γb Tb /m2 .



2.3       The Chapman-Enskog method

The macroscopic balance Eqs. (2.14)–(2.16) are not entirely expressed in terms
of the hydrodynamic fields due to the presence of the pressure tensor P, the heat
flux q and the cooling rate ζ which are given in terms of the one-particle velocity
distribution function f (r, v, t). On the other hand, if this distribution function is
expressed as a functional of the fields, then P, q and ζ will become functionals
of the hydrodynamic fields through Eqs. (2.20)–(2.23) and (2.18). The relations
obtained after integration of (2.20)–(2.23) are the constitutive hydrodynamic re-
lations. They yield a closed set of equations for the hydrodynamic fields n, U and
T . The above hydrodynamic description can be derived by looking for a normal
solution to the Enskog equation. A normal solution is one whose all space and time
dependence of the distribution f (r, v, t) occurs through a functional dependence
on the hydrodynamic fields:

                       f (r, v, t) = f [v|n(r, t), U(r, t), T (r, t)]                (2.24)

That can be achieved by studing the order of magnitude of the various terms
appearing in the Enskog equation (2.6). If we denote by t0 a typical time, L a
typical length and v0 a typical velocity, then:

    ∂f                        ∂f
       = O(t−1
            0 f );       v·      = O(v0 L−1 f );        J[f, f ] = O(nσ d−1 v0 f )   (2.25)
    ∂t                        ∂r

We can relate the quantity nσ d−1 with the mean free path `, that is, the lenght of
the free flight of particles between two successive collisions. For hard spheres,

                                    ` ≈ (nσ d−1 )−1 .                                (2.26)

The combination (v0 `−1 ) can be considered as defining naturally a mean free time
τ and its inverse as a measure of the collision frequency ν.

     It seems clear the existence of two basic nondimensional numbers in the Enskog
equation, τ /t0 and `/L. In a first approximation, we can take time and length
scales to be comparable and, so, we can express the relative magnitudes of both
sides of the Enskog equation by a single non-dimensional number

                                                     `
                                            Kn =       ,                      (2.27)
                                                     L

where Kn is called Knudsen number [155]. The main assumption of the CE method
is that the mean free path ` is small compared with the linear size of gradients L
which is of the order of the linear size of the experiment. In this case, Kn → 0
and there is a clear separation between the microscopic length scale ` and its
macroscopic counterpart L.

     The small Knudsen number condition is equivalent to small spatial gradients of
the hydrodynamic fields, if referred to the microscopic length scale of the mean free
path (the collision frequency). For ordinary (elastic) gases this can be controlled
by the initial or the boundary conditions. However, in granular gases inelasticity
generates an independent macroscopic time derivative [63, 93, 95] and as a conse-
quence, the steady granular flows created by energy injection from the boundaries
may be intrinsically non-Newtonian.

     For small spatial variations, the functional dependence (2.24) can be made
local in space through an expansion in spatial gradients of the hydrodynamic
fields. To generate it, f is expanded in powers of the non-uniformity parameter :

                               f = f (0) + f (1) + 2 f (2) + · · · ,        (2.28)

where each factor  means an implicit gradient. Thus f (0) denotes the solution
in the absence of spatial gradients, f (1) the solution obtained in the linear-order
approximation with respect to the hydrodynamic gradients, f (2) the solution is the
second-order approximation, etc. With these approximations we finally construct
a system of equations where the first one contains only f (0) , the second one f (1)
and f (0) , the third one f (2) , f (1) and f (0) , etc.

     Since f qualifies as a normal solution, then its time derivative can be obtained
as
                            ∂f   ∂f ∂n   ∂f ∂U ∂f ∂T
                               =       +   ·   +       ,                      (2.29)
                            ∂t   ∂n ∂t   ∂U ∂t   ∂T ∂t
Chapter 2. Kinetic Theory of driven granular gases                                      21

where the time derivatives ∂t n, ∂t U, and ∂t T can be determined from the hydro-
dynamic balance Eqs. (2.14)–(2.16)

    In order to establish an appropriate order in the different levels of approxi-
mation in the kinetic equation it is neccesary to charaterize the magnitude of the
external forces (thermostats) in relation with the gradient, as well.

    A different treatment must be given to the relative difference ∆U = U − Ug .
According to the momentum balance Eq. (2.15), in the absence of spatial gradients
U relaxes towards Ug after a transient period. As a consequence, the term ∆U
must be considered to be at least of first order in spatial gradients.

    Following the form of the expansion (2.28), the Enskog collision operator and
time derivative can be also expanded in powers of :

             (0)     (1)     (2)                      (0)     (1)       (2)
     JE = JE + JE + 2 JE + · · · ,           ∂t = ∂t + ∂t + 2 ∂t + · · ·         (2.30)

                             (k)
The action of the operators ∂t         over the hydrodynamic fields can be obtained from
the balance equations (2.14)–(2.16) when one takes into account the corresponding
expansions for the fluxes and the cooling rate.

    The expansions (2.30) lead to similar expansions for the heat and momentum
fluxes when one replaces the expansion (2.28) for f into Eqs. (2.20)-(2.23):

             (0)     (1)         (2)
     Pij = Pij + Pij + 2 Pij + · · · ,        q = q(0) + q(1) + 2 q(2) + · · ·   (2.31)


    These expansions introduced into the Enskog equation lead to a set of integral
equations at different order which can be separately solved. Each equation governs
the evolution of the distribution function on different space and time scales. This
is the usual CE method [59, 105] for solving kinetic equations. The main difference
in this work with respect to previous ones carried out by Brey et al. [31] and Garzó
and Dufty [103] is the new time dependence of the reference state f (0) through the
parameters of the thermostat.

    In contrast to ordinary gases, the form of the zeroth-order solution f (0) is
not Maxwellian, yielding a slightly different functional form [151]. The first order
solution results in the NS equations, while the second and third order expansion
give the so-called Burnett and super-Burnett hydrodynamic equations.
Chapter 2. Kinetic Theory of driven granular gases                                  22

    In this work we shall restrict our calculations to the first order in the parameter
 (Navier-Stokes approximation).



2.4      Grad’s moment method

Apart from the CE method, we will use here the classical Grad’s moment method
[142]. This method is based on the assumption that the velocity distribution
function can be expanded in a complete set of orthogonal polynomials (generalized
Hermite polynomials) of the velocity around a local Maxwellian distribution:

                                                   N
                                                   X −1
                     f (r, v, t) → fM (r, v, t)            Ck (r, t)Hk (v),      (2.32)
                                                    k=0


where                                                     d/2
                                                                       mV2
                                                                         
                                                m
                fM (r, v, t) = n(r, t)                           exp −       .   (2.33)
                                             2πT (r, t)                 2T

    This method was originally devised to solve the Boltzmann equation for monodis-
perse dilute systems although it has been easily extended to determine the NS
transport coefficients of a dense granular fluid described by the Enskog equation
[156, 157, 158, 159] since only kinetic contributions to the fluxes are considered in
the trial expansion [18].

    The coefficients Ck (r, t) appearing in Eq. (2.32) in each of the velocity poly-
nomials Hk (v) are chosen by requiring that the corresponding velocity moments
of Grad’s solution be the same as those of the exact velocity distribution function.
The infinite hierarchy of moment equations is not a closed set of equations and
furthermore some truncation is neccesary in the above expansion after a certain
order. After this truncation, the hierarchy of moment equations becomes a closed
set of coupled equations which can be recursively solved.

    The standard application of Grad’s moment method implies that the retained
moments are the hydrodynamic fields (n, U, and T ) plus the kinetic contributions
to the irreversible momentum and heat fluxes (Pijk −nT δij and qk ). These moments
have to be determined by recursively solving the corresponding transfer equations.
In the three-dimensional case there are 13 moments involved in the form of the
velocity distribution function f and, consequently, this method is usually referred
Chapter 2. Kinetic Theory of driven granular gases                                   23

to as the 13-moment method. The explicit form of the non-equilibrium distribution
function f (r, v, t) in this approximation is

pressure tensor.



2.5      Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method

A different but complementary method used here is the Direct Simulation Monte
Carlo (DSMC) method. This numerical method, first propossed by G.A. Bird
[160, 161, 162], is based on the implementation of a probabilistic Monte Carlo
method [163] in a simulation to solve the Boltzmann equation for rarefied gases
with finite Knudsen number. In these simulations the mean free path of particles
is at least of the same order of a representative physical length scale of the system.

    In the classical DSMC simulations fluids are modeled using numerical particles
which represent a large number of real particles. Particles are moved through a
simulation of physical space in a realistic manner, that is, following the trajectories
given by Newton’s equations for ballistic particles under the action of external
forces if they exist. Collisions between particles are computed using probabilistic,
phenomenological models. Common collision models include the Hard Sphere
model, the Variable Hard Sphere model, and the Variable Soft Sphere model.

    Although the DSMC method does not avoid the assumptions inherent to ki-
netic theory (molecular chaos hypothesis), it gives the possibility of obtaining solu-
tions to the Botlzmann or Enskog equations in non-equilibrium situations without
making any assumption on the validity of a normal or hydrodynamic solution. In
this context, a comparison between numerical and analytical solutions is a direct
way of validating the reliability of kinetic theory for describing granular flows.

2.5.1     Description of DSMC method

The underlying assumption of the DSMC method is that the free movement and
collision phases can be decoupled over time periods that are smaller than the mean
collision time. This basic condition is, in fact, inherent to the Boltzmann equation
and allows us to separately deal with convective and collisional terms in the time
evolution of the velocity distribution function. Thus,

                               ∂t f = −D[f ] + J[f, f ],                       (2.36)

where D is the convective operator defined as:

                                      ∂      ∂
                        D[f ] = v ·      f+    · (m−1 Fext )f,                 (2.37)
                                      ∂r    ∂v

being Fext the external forces acting on particles.

    DSMC simulation is based on spatial and time discretization. Space is divided
into d-dimensional cells with a typical length lc less than a mean free path ` and
time is divided in intervals δt that are taken much smaller than mean free time τ .

    The basic DSMC algorithm is composed by two steps computed in each time
interval: advection and collision stage. The order of those stages has no impor-
tance. In the present work, we will only perform simulations in homogeneous
states and hence, only one cell is used and no boundary conditions are needed.

    The homogeneous velocity distribution function is represented only by the
velocities vi of the N simulated particles:

                                            N
                                        n X
                           f (v, t) →         δ(vi (t) − v).                   (2.38)
                                        N i=0

In the advection phase, velocities of every particle are updated following the corre-
sponding Newton’s equations of movement under the action of the external forces:

                                      vi → vi + wi ,                           (2.39)

As we pointed out before, our thermostat is composed by two differents terms:
a deterministic external force porportional to the velocity of the particle plus a
stochastic force. Thus, wi = widrag + wist , where widrag and wist denote the velocity
increments due to the drag and stochastic forces, respectively. In the case of the
Chapter 2. Kinetic Theory of driven granular gases                                      25

drag force the velocity increment is given by

                                 widrag = (1 − eγb δt )vi ,                         (2.40)

while wist is randomly drawn from the Gaussian probability distribution with a
variance characterized by the noise intensity ξb2 fulfilling the conditions:

                           hwi i = 0,       hwi wj i = ξb2 δtδij ,                  (2.41)

where
                                                        2     2
                            P (w) = (2πξb2 δt)−d/2 e−w /(2ξb δt)                    (2.42)

is a Gaussian probability distribution [150].

    Intrinsic time scales produced by the inclusion of the two thermostat forces
in our system (τdrag = m/γb and τst = v02 /ξb2 ) must be not too fast compared to
the algorithm time step δt (which is small compared to the characteristic collision
time) in order to describe properly the collision integral of the Enskog equation
[162]. Thus, τdrag ≤ ν −1 and τst ≤ ν −1 where ν = v0 /`.

    In the collision stage a sample of 21 N ωmax δt pairs of particles (i,j) are choosen
at random with equiprobability where N is the number of particles and ωmax
is an upper bound estimate of the probability that a particle collides per unit of
time. For each pair (i, j) belonging to this sample a given direction σ
                                                                      b ij is chosen at
random with equiprobability and the collision between particles i and j is accepted
                                    b ij )ωij /ωmax where ωij = (4πnσ 2 χ)|gij · σ
with a probability equal to Θ(gij · σ                                            b ij | for
hard spheres and ωij = (2πnσχ)|gij · σ
                                     b ij | for hard disks. Here, gij = vi − vj is the
relative velocity. If the collision is accepted, post-collisional velocities are assigned
according to the scatering rule (2.13). If the frequency ωij > ωmax for any collision,
the estimate of ωmax is updated as ωmax = ωij [151]. It is worthwhile to remark
here that the acceptance probability Θ(gij · σ
                                             b ij )ωij /ωmax is independent of the pair
correlation function and, thus, the DSMC algorithm is formally identical for both
Boltzmann and Enskog equations when they describe homogeneous systems.

Homogeneous state




3.1         Introduction

Under rapid flow conditions (state which can be reached by externally vibrating or
shearing the system [166]), the grains interact by nearly instantaneous collisions
(compared with the mean free time) and their motion resembles the clasical picture
of a molecular gas. In these conditions, kinetic theory can be a quite useful tool
to study these systems [18]. Thus, in order to maintain the granular medium in a
fluidized state, an external energy input is needed for collisional cooling compen-
sation and for attaining a steady state. In most experiments, energy is supplied
through the boundaries. This creates spatial gradients in the system. To avoid the
difficulties associated with non-homogeneous states, it is usual in computer sim-
ulations to homogeneously heat the system by the action of an external driving
force (thermostat).

    Nevertheless, in spite of its practical importance, little is known about the
influence of the external force (or thermostat) on the properties of the system
[58, 59].
    The results obtained in this Chapter have been published in M.G. Chamorro, F. Vega Reyes,
and V. Garzó, AIP Conf. Proc. 1501:1024-1030, (2012) and M.G. Chamorro, F. Vega Reyes

Chapter 3. Homogeneous state                                                       28

    The goal of this Chapter is to analyze the homogeneous steady state of a driven
granular fluid described by the Enskog kinetic equation. The particles are assumed
to be under the action of an external thermostat composed by two different forces:
(i) a stochastic force where the particles are randomly kicked between collisions
[149] and (ii) a viscous drag force which mimics the interaction of the particles
with an effective viscous bath at temperature Tb . The viscous drag force allows
us to model the friction from a surrounding fluid over a moderately dense set of
spheres [62] while the stochastic force would model the energy transfer from the
surrounding fluid molecules to the granular particles due to molecular thermal
motions in a similar way as in a Brownian particle. There exists, thus, a balance
in the system between the injection of energy due to the stochastic thermostat and
the loss of it due to the friction and particle collisions. Given an arbitrary initial
state, the system will evolve towards a steady state characterized by a constant
and homogeneous granular temperature.

    Under these conditions, our kinetic equation has the structure of a Fokker-
Planck equation [167] plus the corresponding inelastic collisional operator of the
Enskog equation.

    One of the main advantages of using this kind of thermostat [55] with respect
to others present in the literature [149] is that the temperature of the thermostat Tb
(different from the temperature T < Tb of the granular fluid) is always well defined.
In particular, for elastic collisions, the fluid equilibrates to the bath temperature
(T = Tb ). This happens because, in addition to the random driving, the thermostat
acts on the grains also through a finite drag. Moreover, some recent results [168]
suggest that this thermostat is the most appropriate to model some experiments.



3.2      Enskog Kinetic Theory for
         Homogeneous Driven States

For a spatially uniform system, the Enskog kinetic equation for f (v, t) reads:

                               γb ∂       1 ∂2
                      ∂t f −        · vf − ξb2 2 f = χJ[f, f ].                  (3.1)
                               m ∂v       2 ∂v

    In the homogeneous state the mean flux velocity is constant and uniform, and
so, one can choose an appropriate frame of reference where this velocity vanishes
without lost of generality (U = 0 and hence V = v). Furthermore, the energy
balance is the only relevant equation. Energy balance is obtained from Eq. (3.1)
by multiplying it by V 2 and integrating over velocity. The result is

                                          2T
                              ∂t T = −       γb + mξb2 − ζT,                    (3.2)

is the cooling rate proportional to 1 − α2 . This term describes the loss of kinetic
energy due to the inelastic character of collisions.

    In the hydrodynamic regime, the distribution function f qualifies as a normal
solution for the Boltzmann equation and therefore its time dependence only oc-
curs through the hydrodynamic fields. Therefore, given that the only relevant
hydrodynamic field is T (t) then the time dependence of f is through T (t):

    In the long time limit, the system reaches a steady state in which the energy
lost due to inelastic collision and drag force is compensated by the heating due to
the stochastic force. Let us call Ts the value of the granular temperature at the

where ζs is the cooling rate evaluated in the steady state. This equation establishes
a relation between the two driving parameters γb and ξb2 and the inelasticity of
the particles, and hence, only one of them will be considered as independent at a
fixed α.

    Using Eq. (3.8) in Eq. (3.5) we obtain the kinetic equation of the steady
distribution function fs :

    Note that the solution of Eq. (3.9) must depend on the model parameter ξb2 ,
the steady granular temperature Ts and the coefficient of restitution α.

    This allows us to consider that all the time dependence of the velocity dis-
tribution function occurs only through the time-dependent square velocity, that
is, the temperature. Consequently it is expected that Eq. (3.9) admits a scaling
solution of the form:

velocity and ξs∗ is the scaled model parameter defined as

    In terms of the scaled distribution function, the Eq. (3.9) can be rewritten as:

is the collision frequency [105].

    It is easy to see from Eq. (3.12) that the dependence on the temperature of
the scaled distribution function ϕ is through the dimensionless velocity c and the
reduced noise strength ξ ∗ . This differs from the HCS and for homogeneously gases
heated by a single thermostat [150, 151, 169], where only one parameter (scaled
velocity) was neccesary to characterize the stationary distribution function ϕ. A
similar scaling solution to the form (3.10) has been recently used in the transient
time-dependent regime for a granular gas driven by a stochastic force [170].

    In the elastic limit (α = 1), the cooling rate vanishes and the solution of Eq.
(3.12) is a Maxwellian distribution [105, 145, 171]

                                                      2

    Note that in this case the scaled distribution function does not depend on the
thermostat forces. However when the particles collide inelastically (α < 1) the
cooling rate has a non-zero value and the exact form of the distribution function
is unknown. In that case we can find an approximate solution in the regions
of thermal velocities (c ∼ 1) by measuring the departure of ϕ(c, ξ ∗ ) from the
Maxwellian function (3.15) through the first nontrivial coefficients of an expansion
in Sonine polynomials [25].

    The steady-state condition (3.8) can be rewritten using reduced units as:

                                     2γs∗ = ξs∗ − ζs∗ ,                       (3.16)

where
                                               γb
                                      γs∗ =                                   (3.17)
                                              χmνs
is the reduced drag coefficient.

    Since γs∗ ≥ 0, equation (3.16) requires ξs∗ ≥ ζs∗ . Thus, there exists a minimum
                    ∗
threshold value of ξth (α) of the noise intensity for a given restitution coefficient
α needed to reach a steady state. This minimum value occurs when γs∗ = 0 and
coincides with the reduced cooling rate ζs∗ (α). Given that the latter cannot be

scaled distribution function ϕ by its Maxwellian form ϕM [148]. In this case:

be easily solved to give a2 and a3 in terms of d, α and ξ ∗ . As noted previously
by Montanero and Santos [150, 174], there exists a certain degree of ambiguity
in the approximations used in the determination of a2 and a3 . Here, two kinds
of approximations will be used to solve the set of equations. In the first one
(Approximation I) we consider a3  a2 in the collisional moments µ2 and µ4
but not in µ6 given that the latter is expected to be smaller than µ4 . With this
approach, a2 can be independently calculated of a3 from Eq. (3.37) with a3 = 0.

by Eqs. (A.14) and (A.15), respectively.



3.4      Numerical solutions of the BE equation

In the previous sections, we have used analytical tools to obtain a solution to the
Enskog equation as an expansion of the velocity distribution function in Sonine
polynomials. As it was before mentioned, and given the complex structure of
Enskog equation, it is very difficult to get an exact solution for far from equilib-
rium situations. For this reason, it is necessary to resort to perturbative methods
only valid in situations near equilibrium or kinetic models that, given the sim-
plifications which they are based on, may involve results quite different to those
directly obtained from the Boltzmann equation [175]. In our case, several kinds of
truncations have been neccesary to get an approximate expresion for the Sonine
expansion for the Enskog equation.

    In this Section we obtain the exact solution of Eq. (3.1) by means of the
DSMC method. The DSMC solution has the advantage that it can also determine
transport states and neither an a priori assumption of a normal solution nor a
Chapter 3. Homogeneous state                                                      36

specific scaling form of the distribution function must be introduced. Therefore, a
comparison of both numerical and analytical solutions is a direct way of validating,
for steady states, the hypothesis of existence of a normal solution and of the
special scaling form of the distribution function used in Eq. (3.12). The simulation
code used here was based on the one previously used in Ref. [176] for studying
a segregation criterion based on the thermal diffusion factor of an intruder in a
heated granular gas described by the inelastic Enskog equation.

    For practical reasons we have introduced in our simulations the following di-
                          ∗        ∗
mensionless quantitites (γsim and ξsim ) characterizing the driving parameters:

simulation reduced quantities γsim and ξsim and their corresponding theoretical
ones γ ∗ and ξ ∗ , respectively.

    In the simulations carried out, the system is always initialized with a Maxwellian
velocity distribution with temperature T0 . A number of particles N = 2 × 106 and
a time step δt = 5 × 10−2 ν0 has been used, where ν0 = (2T0 /m)1/2 nσ d−1 and T0 is
the initial temperature.



3.4.1     Comparison between theory and simulations

In this Section we compare numerical results of DSMC simulations with analyt-
ical ones obtained in previous sections. In particular, we are interested in the
scaled distribution function and the coefficients that measure its deviation from
the Maxwellian distribution function corresponding to a state in equilibrium.


3.4.1.1    Transient regime


Although the main target in this work is the evaluation of all the relevant quanti-
ties of the problem (a2 , a3 and ϕ) in the steady state, it is worthwhile to analyze
the approach of some of these quantities towards the steady state. Fig. 3.1 shows
Chapter 3. Homogeneous state                                                          37

the time evolution of a) the reduced temperature T (t)/Ts and b) the distribu-
tion function ϕ(c0 ) for the dimensionless velocity c0 = v0,s /v0 (t). Here, Ts and
       p
v0,s = 2Ts /m refer to the theoretical steady values of the granular temperature
and thermal velocity, respectively. The solid horizontal lines correspond to the the-
oretical predictions by considering the first two non-Gaussian corrections (third
Sonine approximation) to the distribution ϕ [see Eq. (3.19)]. We have made runs
of identical systems except that they are initialized with different temperatures.
After a transient regime, as expected we observe that all simulation data tend
to collapse to the same steady values for sufficiently long times. In addition, the
corresponding steady values obtained from the simulation for both temperature
and distribution function practically coincide with those predicted by the Sonine
solution. It is also to be noticed that the convergence to the steady values occurs
approximately at the same time for both T (t)/Ts and ϕ(c0 ) (thermal fluctuations
make difficult to determine the exact point for steady state convergence for the
distribution function). This is another and indirect way of checking that indeed
the normal solution exists for simulations, since its existence implies, from Eq.
(3.4), that we reach the scaled form (3.10) when the temperature is stationary.

    Some previous works on a granular gas heated by the stochastic thermostat
[170] and on the simple shear flow [177] have shown that before reaching the steady
state the system evolves towards a universal unsteady state that depends on a new
parameter measuring the distance to the steady state. A similar behavior is ex-
pected here where the different solutions to the Enskog equation (3.1) would be at-
                                                                                   ˜

where c(t) = v/v0 (t) and

    The dimensionless driving parameters γ̃(t) and ξ(t)
the steady state. For asymptotically long times, the steady state is eventually
                              ˜
reached, i.e., ϕ(c(t), γ̃(t), ξ(t)) → ϕs (c, ξ ∗ ). The above unsteady hydrodynamic
regime (for which the system has forgotten its initial condition) is expected to be
achieved after a certain number of collisions per particle.

                                     p Ts is the steady value of the temperature

    speed.The symbols correspond to the simulation results while the horizontal
    lines refer to the theoretical predictions for Ts and ϕ(c0 ). The latter has been
    obtained by retaining the three first Sonine polynomials (see Eq. (3.47)) and
    evaluating a2 and a3 with Approximation II. Time is measured in units of ν −1
    (t∗ = tν −1 ).


3.4.1.2    Steady regime


Now, we will focus on the steady state values of the relevant quantities of the prob-
lem. In particular, the basic quantities measuring the deviation of the distribution
function from its Maxwellian form are the second and third Sonine coefficients a2
and a3 , respectively. The dependence of a2 and a3 on the coefficient of restitution
α is shown in Figs. 3.2 and 3.3, respectively, for hard disks (a) and spheres (b).

                                                                            ∗
Three different systems with different values of the simulation parameters γsim
     ∗
and ξsim but with the same value of ξ ∗ (ξ ∗ = 1.263 for disks and ξ ∗ = 1.688 for
spheres) have been considered. We observe that, at a given α, the correspond-
ing three simulation data collapse in a common curve, showing that indeed both
Sonine coefficients are always of the form ai (α, ξ ∗ ). Regarding the comparison
between theory and simulation, it is quite apparent that while both Approxima-
tions I and II compare quantitatively quite well with simulations in the case of a2 ,
Approximation II has a better performance than Approximation I in the case of
a3 , specially at very strong dissipation. This is the expected result since Approxi-
mation II is in principle more accurate that Approximation I, although the latter
is simpler than the former. In this sense and with respect to the α-dependence of
a2 and a3 , Approximation I could be perhaps preferable to Approximation II since
it has an optimal compromise between simplicity and accuracy.

    On the other hand, more quantitative discrepancies between both Approxima-
tions are found when one analyzes both Sonine coefficients vs. ξ ∗ with constant
α. Figs. 3.4 and 3.5 show a2 and a3 , respectively, versus ξ ∗ at α = 0.7. We see
that Approximation I exhibits a poor agreement with simulations since it predicts
a dependence on the noise strength opposite to the one found in the simulations.
On the other hand, Approximation II agrees very well with simulation data in all
the range of values of ξ ∗ (note that ξ ∗ & 0.639 for d = 2 and ξ ∗ & 0.852 for d = 3
to achieve a steady state for α = 0.7). It must be also noted that for the systems
studied in Figs. 3.4 and 3.5, although the magnitudes of both Sonine coefficients
are very small, |a2 | is of the order of ten times smaller than |a3 |. This may indicate
a poor convergence of the Sonine polynomial expansion [173] for high inelasticity.



    The small values of the coefficients a2 and a3 support the assumption of a low-
order truncation in polynomial expansion and suggests that the scaled distribution
function ϕ(c, ξ ∗ ) for thermal velocities can be well represented by the three first
contributions (note that a1 = 0) in the Sonine polynomial expansion (3.19). To
confirm it, we have measured the deviation of ϕ(c, ξ ∗ ) from its Maxwellian form
ϕM (c). In Figs. 3.6 an 3.7 we plot the ratio ϕ(c, ξ ∗ )/ϕM (c) versus the reduced
velocity c in the steady state for two values of the coefficient of restitution (α = 0.8
and α = 0.6). As before, we have considered a system of inelastic hard disks (Fig.
3.6 with ξ ∗ = 1.26) and inelastic hard spheres (Fig. 3.7 with ξ ∗ = 1.69). As in Figs.
3.2–3.5, symbols correspond to simulation results obtained for different values of

simulations confirm that the reduced distribution function ϕ(c, ξ ∗ ) is a universal
function of ξ ∗ since all simulation series at constant ξ ∗ collapse to the same curve
(within non-measurable marginal error). We also see that the simulation curves
agree very well with the corresponding third-order Sonine polynomial in this range
of velocities, especially in the two-dimensional case. Surprisingly, in the high
velocity region, the curves obtained from Approximation I fit the simulation data
slightly better than those obtained by using the improved Approximation II. In any
case, the agreement between theory and simulation is again excellent, especially
taking into account the very small discrepancies we are measuring.

3.5     Summary and Discussion

In this Chapter we have analyzed the homogeneous steady state of a granular
gas driven by a stochastic bath with friction described with the Enskog kinetic
equation. One of the primary objectives of this work has been to check the velocity
scaling and the functional form assumed for the distribution function in the steady
state. As Eq. (3.10) indicates, the new feature of the scaled distribution ϕ is the
dependence on both the granular temperature T through the scaled velocity c and
also through the reduced noise strength ξ ∗ [defined in Eq. (3.11)]. The simulation
results reported here (see Figs. 3.6 and 3.7) have confirmed the above dependence

since different systems sharing the same values of ξ ∗ and α lead to the same
distribution function ϕ. This is consistent with the existence of a normal solution
in the long-time limit.

    We have also characterized the distribution ϕ through its first velocity mo-
ments. More specifically, we have obtained the second a2 and third a3 Sonine
coefficients. While the coefficient a2 measures the fourth-degree velocity moment
of ϕ, the coefficient a3 is defined in terms of the sixth-degree velocity moment of
ϕ. Both Sonine coefficients provide information on the deviation of ϕ from its
Maxwellian form ϕM . Moreover, the knowledge of those coefficients is important;
for instance, in the precise determination of the transport coefficients [111]. On the

other hand, given that the Sonine coefficients cannot be exactly determined (they
obey an infinite hierarchy of moments), one has to truncate the corresponding
Sonine polynomial expansion in order to estimate them. Here, we have considered
two different approaches (Approximation I and II) to get explicit expressions of a2
and a3 in terms of the dimensionality of the system d, the coefficient of restitution
α and the driving parameter ξ ∗ . Approximation II is more involved than Approx-
imation I since it considers both Sonine coefficients as being of the same order of

shows in general a good agreement, even for high-inelasticity for both approaches.
Moreover, the improved Approximation II for a2 and a3 shows only a slightly bet-
ter agreement with simulations than Approximation I (see Figs. 3.2–3.5). Thus,
taking into account all the above comparisons, we can conclude that a good com-
promise between accuracy and simplicity is represented by Approximation I.

    The results derived in this Chapter show clearly that the combination of an-
alytical and computational tools (based on the DSMC method) turns out to be a
useful way to characterize properties in granular flows. On the other hand, given
that most of the Sonine coefficients can be directly calculated by DSMC, one could
in principle make a least-square fit to obtain explicit forms for those coefficients.
However, this procedure would not be satisfactory from a more fundamental point
of view, especially if one is interested in capturing the behavior of ϕ(c) and its
Sonine polynomial expansion. In this context, our analytical solution of the dis-
tribution function (redundant as it may seem) has the advantage of providing a
rational description of the physical properties of the kinetic equation of the system.
This is not accomplished by the numerical solution. Nevertheless, the fact that
the DSMC method gives an accurate numerical solution of the Enskog equation
makes it complementary to the theoretical one and thus both conform a complete
description of the kinetic equation of our system.

Transport properties for driven
granular fluids in situations close
to homogeneous steady states




4.1      Introduction

The aim of the present Chapter is to study the transport properties of a moder-
ately dense granular gas driven by a stochastic bath with friction in the frame of
the Enskog kinetic theory. The homogeneous steady state described in Chapter 3
is now perturbed by small spatial gradients in the hydrodynamical fields and the
response of the system to these perturbations will give rise to nonzero contribu-
tions to the heat and momentum fluxes which are characterized by the transport
coefficients. In order to obtain them, states that deviate from steady homogeneous
states by small spatial gradientes are considered and, therefore, the Enskog kinetic
equation (2.6) is solved by means of the CE method [105] conveniently adapted to
dissipative dynamics.
    The results obtained in this Chapter have been published in V. Garzó, M.G. Chamorro and

4.2      Small spatial perturbations around the Ho-
         mogeneous Steady State

In the previous Chapter, the velocity distribution function of a driven granular gas
in homogenous steady conditions was characterized by means of the coefficients of
the Sonine expansion. In particular the first two non-zero coefficients a2 and a3
were calculated by using two different approximations. On the other hand, Figs.
3.2 and 3.3 show that, in general, a3 is much smaller than a2 and thus in further
calculations of the present Chapter the coefficient a3 will be neglected. In that
case, the steady cooling rate ζs can be written up to the first order in the Sonine
expansion in terms of a2,s as
                                                                 r

    To illustrate the dependence of Ts on both α and φ, Fig. 4.1 shows the (re-
duced) steady temperature Ts /Tb versus the volume fraction φ for two different
values of the coefficient of restitution α. The theoretical results obtained from
Eq. (4.2) for hard disks (d = 2) are compared with those obtained by numerically
solving the Enskog equation from the DSMC method [162]. As in Ref. [55], the
fixed parameters of the simulations are m = 1, σ = 0.01, γb = 1, ξb2 = 2, and
Tb = 1.

    We observe an excellent agreement between theory and simulation in the com-
plete range of values of φ considered. As expected, at a given value of the solid
volume fraction, the steady granular temperature Ts decreases as the gas becomes
more inelastic.

    Once the homogeneous steady state is characterized, our goal now is to solve
the Enskog equation by means of the CE expansion. We consider here the zeroth
and the first-order approximations.



4.2.1      Zeroth-order approximation

Inserting Eqs. (2.28) and (2.30) into Eq. (2.6) and arranging terms of the same
order in the parameter , we can determine the different approximations to f
separately. To zeroth-order in the expansion, the distribution f (0) obeys the kinetic
equation

where JE [f (0) , f (0) ] is given by Eq. (2.12) with the replacements of the steady
state density ns and distribution function fs by their unsteady non-homogeneous
versions n(r, t) and f (0) (r, v, t), respectively. In addition, as mentioned in Chapter
2, the term ∆U = U − Ug is considered to be at least of first order in spatial
gradients.

    The conservation laws of the hydrodynamic fields at this order are given by

                                       (0)           (0)

where ζ (0) is determined by Eq. (4.1) to zeroth-order. Thus, in the zeroth-order
approximation ζ (0) is given by Eq. (4.1) with ns → n(r, t) and Ts → T (r, t).

    The time derivative ∂t f (0) can be rewritten more explicity in terms of the

                                   m    T             ∂T

With this result, Eq. (4.3) reduces to

   2γb mξb2            ∂f (0) γb ∂           1 ∂2
                  

    At this level of the derivation, it is worthwhile noting that for given values
of the thermostat parameters γb and ξb2 and the coefficient of restitution α, the
steady state condition (3.8) establishes a mapping between the density n(r, t)
and temperature T (r, t) and hence, every density corresponds to one and only
one temperature. Since the density and temperature are given separately in the
reference local state f (0) , the collisional cooling is only partially compensated for
                                                             (0)
the energy injected by the thermostat forces and so, ∂t T 6= 0. Consequently,
the zeroth-order distribution function f (0) depends on time through its functional
dependence on the temperature. On the other hand, for simplicity, one could
                                                                                (0)
impose the steady-state condition (3.8) at any point of the system and so, ∂t T =
0. This was the choice used in previous theoretical works [106, 107] in the case of
the stochastic thermostat (γb = 0) where the relation mξb2 = ζ (0) T was assumed
to apply also in the non-homogeneous state.

    As we will see below, while the expressions of the shear and bulk viscosities

computer simulations at the level of kinetic theory, the fact that ∂t T 6= 0 gives
rise to conceptual and practical difficulties not present in the previous analysis

in a CE-like method proposed to analyze rheological properties around the steady
shear flow state [178, 179].

    Although for granular gases the drag parameter γb and the white noise ξb2
can be considered in general as independent parameters, to make contact here
with previous results obtained for granular fluids [55, 168], we assume that both
parameters are related by
                                                m2 ξb2
                                       γb = β          ,                          (4.8)
                                                 Tb
where β is an arbitrary constant. Thus, when β = 0, γb = 0 and our thermostat
reduces to the stochastic thermostat [180] while the choice β = 1/2 leads to the
conventional Fokker-Plank model for ordinary gases [154]. According to Eq. (4.8),
the reduced parameter γ ∗ ≡ γb `/mv0 can be expressed in terms of ξ ∗ as
                                                                      !2/3

                   γ ∗ = θξ ∗1/3 ,   θ≡β                   p                 .    (4.9)
                                               nσ d−1 Tb    2Tb /m

Note that here the reduced model parameter ξ ∗ is defined as in Eq. (3.11) with
the replacement Ts → T (r, t). Upon writing Eq. (4.9), use has been made of the
identity βT ∗ = θξ ∗−2/3 , where T ∗ = T (t)/Tb

    In the unsteady state, the zeroth-order distribution function obeys Eq. (3.5).
Dimensional analysis requires that f (0) is also given by the scaled form (3.10) [once
one uses the relation (4.8)], namely,

                      f (0) (r, v, t) → n(r, t) v0 (r, t)−d ϕ(c, θ, ξ ∗ ),       (4.10)

where now c = V/v0 . In this case, the thermal velocity v0 and the reduced
parameter ξ ∗ are local quantities according to their definitions with the change
Ts → T (r, t). The scaling (4.10) gives rise to the presence of new terms in the
kinetic equations. As in the steady state, the temperature dependence of f (0) is
not only through v0 and c but also through ξ ∗ . Thus,

                            ∂f (0)    1 ∂            3 ∂f (0)

      As in the previous Chapter, the explicit form of the solution of Eq. (4.12) is
not known. However, it is possible to obtain certain information on the scaled
distribution function ϕ through its fourth cumulant a2 (α, ξ ∗ ). To obtain this
cumulant, we multiply both sides of Eq. (4.12) by c4 and integrate over velocity.
The result is

     3d(d + 2)                            ∂a2 d(d + 2) ∗

      In the steady state, Eq. (3.8) applies and the first term on the left hand side of
Eq. (4.15) vanishes. In this case, the solution to Eq. (4.15) is given by Eq. (3.40).
In general, due to its complexity, Eq. (4.15) must be solved numerically to get
the dependence of a2 on the thermostat reduced parameter ξ ∗ (or on the reduced
temperature T ∗ ). However, in the vicinity of the steady state, it is possible to give
an analytical expression for ∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ . This derivative appears in the expressions of
the heat flux transport coefficients and the first order contribution to the cooling
rate ζU . In order to determine ∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ from Eq. (4.15), we first assume that ϕ can
be well described by the lowest Sonine approximation (3.19). Then, approximate
forms for ζ0∗ = (2/d)µ2 and µ4 are obtained when one uses the distribution (3.19)
and neglects nonlinear terms in a2 . The results are:

    Substituting these terms in Eq. (4.15) and retaining only linear terms in a2 ,
one obtains the relation

    However, some care must be taken in Eq. (4.21) at the steady state, since
the numerator and denominator of Eq. (4.21) vanish. Thus, the corresponding
expression for the derivative ∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ in the steady state becomes indeterminate.
This difficulty can be solved by means of l’Hopital’s rule. After some algebra, it is
straightforward to see that the steady-state value of the derivative ∆ ≡ (∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ )s
obeys the quadratic equation:
                                                                           

                2

where Ts∗ = Ts /Tb . Since a2,s is in general very small, it is expected that the
magnitude of ∆ be also quite small. An analysis of the solutions to Eq. (4.22)
shows that in general one of its roots is much larger than a2,s while the other is of
the order of a2,s . We take the latter one as the physical root of the quadratic Eq.
(4.22).

    Since ∆ is in general very small, one may neglect the term proportional to
   2
(∆) in Eq. (4.22). In this case, the derivative ∆ can be explicitly written as

                                                   a2,s

take the last form (4.23).

4.2.2     First-order approximation

The analysis to first order in the spatial gradients is similar to the one worked out
in the undriven case [103, 104]. Some technical details on the determination of
the transport coefficients and the cooling rate are provided in Appendices B and
C. The form of the first-order velocity distribution function f (1) is given by

where the quantities A (V), B (V), Cij (V) and D (V) are the solutions of the
linear integral Eqs. (B.16)–(B.19), respectively. However, the evaluation of the
transport coefficients from the above integral equations requires to know the com-
plete time dependence of the first order contributions to the pressure tensor and
the heat flux vector. This is quite an intricate problem. On the other hand,
some simplifications occur if attention is restricted to linear deviations from the
steady state. In particular, since the kinetic and collisional contributions to the
heat and momentum fluxes are already of first order in the deviations from the
steady state, one only needs to know the transport coefficients to zeroth order in
the deviations. This means that we can evaluate the transport coefficients under
steady state conditions, namely, when the condition (3.8) applies.

    In this case, Eqs. (B.16)–(B.19) become

    Moreover, in Eqs. (4.26)–(4.29), it is understood that the quantities A(V),
B(V), Cij (V), and D(V) [defined in Appendix B by Eqs. (B.7)–(B.10), respec-
tively] and the derivatives ∂ζ (0) /∂ξ ∗ and ∂ζ (0) /∂θ are evaluated in the steady
state. Consequently, all the transport coefficients are given in terms of the steady
granular temperature Ts .

    The forms of the collisional contributions to the momentum and heat fluxes are
exactly the same as those previously obtained in the undriven case [103, 104] except
that a2,s depends on ξs∗ [see Eq. (3.40)]. Thus, we will focus here our attention
in the evaluation of the kinetic contributions to the transport coefficients and the
cooling rate. Technical details on this calculation are given in Appendix C.



4.3      Transport coefficients

To first-order in the spatial gradients (NS hydrodynamics), the pressure tensor
and the heat flux are given by

where η, λ and κ are called respectively shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and thermal
conductivity. As for ordinary gases, the shear viscosity characterizes the flux of
momentum due to the gradient of the flow velocity whereas the thermal conduc-
tivity characterizes the heat flux due to the gradient of temperature. Here, a new
coefficient µ (the diffusive heat or Dufour-like coefficient) not present in ordinary
gases arises which relates the heat flux with the density gradient [31, 181].

Here, we provide the final expressions for the shear and bulk viscosities. Technical
details of the calculations are given in Appendix C. While the shear viscosity

    In Eq. (4.47), the contributions proportional to the derivatives ∂a2 /∂χ and
∂a2 /∂θ have been neglected for the sake of simplicity.

    Note that the first-order contribution ζU to the cooling rate vanishes for elastic
gases (α = 1, arbitrary solid volume fraction φ). However, for dilute inelastic
gases (φ = 0, arbitrary values of the coefficient of restitution α), at variance with
the undriven case [31] there is here a nonzero contribution to ζU proportional to
(∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ )s [see Eq. (4.47)]. This result is consistent with those obtained [180] from
the Boltzmann equation.

the forms of κ and µ are different to those derived from the choice A.

complicated, given the different parameters (inelasticity, density and the model

dence of each parameter on transport, it is instructive to consider some simple
cases.

The expressions (4.53) and (4.54) agree with recent results [170] derived from
the linearized Boltzmann equation for a granular gas heated by the stochastic
thermostat (β = 0). In addition, as mentioned before, when β = 12 in Eq. (4.8), our
model reduces to the Fokker-Planck model studied previously by Hayakawa [154]
for dilute gases. In that paper, Hayakawa determines the transport coefficients η,
κ, and µ by neglecting the dependence of the fourth cumulant a2 on the (reduced)
model parameters γ ∗ and ξ ∗ . In particular, in the steady state, Eqs. (4.53)–(4.55)
agree with the results obtained in Ref. [154] when (∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ )s = 0. All the above
limit situations confirm the self-consistency of the results derived here for a dense
granular fluid.



4.4      Comparison with computer simulations

The expressions obtained in Sec. 4.3 for the transport coefficients and the cooling
rate depend on the (steady) granular temperature Ts , the coefficient of restitution
α, the solid volume fraction φ along with the parameter ξb2 characterizing the
external energy source. In this Section we will compare our theoretical predictions
for the thermostats A and B with recent Langevin dynamics simulations carried
out by Gradenigo et al. [55] for hard disks (d = 2). In these simulations, the fluid
is also driven by a stochastic bath with friction and the two external parameters γb
and ξb2 are related by Eq. (4.8) with β = 21 . In the steady state, they measured the
static and dynamic structure factors for shear and longitudinal modes for several
values of the coefficient of restitution α and volume fraction φ. The corresponding
best fit of the simulation results of the above structure factors allows them to
identify the kinematic viscosity ν = η/ρ, the longitudinal viscosity

    Fig. (4.3) shows the kinematic viscosity ν for disks as a function of the volume
fraction φ for α = 0.6. Symbols refer to the values of ν obtained from Langevin
dynamics simulations by Gradenigo et al. [55] by using two different procedures:
(i) via the equal-time correlation of the transversal shear mode (static correla-
tions) and (ii) via the correlation of the transversal shear mode at different times
(dynamical correlations). As in Fig. 4.1, the parameters of the simulation are
γb = 1, Tb = 1, m = 1 and σ = 0.01. We observe first that the simulation data
obtained with the two independent procedures are compatible. Regarding the
theoretical results, note that for the kinematic viscosity the results obtained by
using both kind of thermostats are the same. The theoretical prediction for η in
the elastic limit [i.e., Eq. (4.35) with α = 1 and γb = ξb = 0] but considering the
α-dependence of the granular temperature given by Eq. (4.2) is also plotted. This
was the theoretical expression for ν used in Ref. [55] to compare with simulation
data. At a qualitative level, we observe that both theories (the elastic Enskog
theory and the one derived here) reproduce the general trends of simulation data.
However, at a more quantitative level, it appears that the analytical results ob-
tained here for granular fluids agree much better with simulation data than those

viscosity ν since both theories agree relatively well. However, the discrepancies
with computer simulations are more important than in the case of ν, specially in
the low-density limit (φ = 0.1). While the elastic theory is closer to the simulation
data than the inelastic theory when α = 0.8 [panel (a) of Fig. 4.4], the opposite
happens at α = 0.6 for denser systems [see the panel (b) of Fig. 4.4]. Since
the dependence of the shear viscosity η on φ is well captured by the inelastic

Enskog theory (see Fig. 4.3), it is evident that the discrepancies between theory
and simulations are essentially due to the bulk viscosity λ, whose value is specially
underestimated at low-density. This is a quite surprising result since one would
expect that the influence of λ on the value of νl increases with increasing density
since λ = 0 for a dilute gas (φ = 0).

    The thermal diffusivity is shown in Fig. 4.5 for the same cases as those con-
sidered in Figs. 4.3 and 4.4. Surprisingly, for strong dissipation and quite dense
systems [see the panel (b) of Fig. 4.5], the comparison between theory and simu-
lation agrees in general better when one uses the elastic form for DT instead of its
inelastic expression (4.35). These results contrast with the ones recently obtained
[107] for the stochastic driving (i.e., when γb → 0, keeping γb Tb finite) where it
was shown the accuracy of the inelastic Enskog theory (see Fig. 1 of Ref. [107])
for moderate densities and finite collisional dissipation. It is important to note
that the identification of the transport coefficients from Langevin dynamics sim-
ulations requires to fit the simulation results for small but not zero values of the
wave number k. Given that the expressions for the Enskog transport coefficients
are independent of the wave number (since the hydrodynamic regime only strictly
holds in the limit k → 0), it is possible that the transport coefficients measured
in the simulations are still functions of k, specially when the smallest value of k
considered to get the fit results is not close to 0. In particular, the simulation data
for φ = 0.3 and 0.5 in the panel (b) of Fig. 4.4 were obtained for kσ = 0.4 and
0.5, respectively. In this sense, if we extrapolate the data shown in Table 3 of Ref.
[55], one could conclude that the true value of DT is smaller than the one shown in
this figure when kσ = 0. More simulations would be needed to clarify this point.

    Now we consider the α-dependence of the transport coefficient µ and the first-
order contribution ζU to the cooling rate. Given that both coefficients vanish in
the elastic limit, they were also neglected in previous studies for heated granular
fluids [53, 55]. To assess the impact of the term −µ∇n in the heat flux, the reduced
coefficient µn/(T κ) is plotted in Fig. 4.6 versus the coefficient of restitution for
two different values of the volume fraction φ in the case of the choice A. Given
that the derivatives (∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ ), (∂a2 /∂θ) and (∂a2 /∂χ) are in general very small,
for the sake of simplicity the contributions proportional to those derivatives have
been neglected in the evaluation of µ in Fig. 4.6.

    The results derived for µ by using the choice B are also plotted for comparison
in the case φ = 0.1. We observe that the coefficient µ is negative in the case of

of choice B is not present in the case of the choice A since µ is always positive for
any value of α and φ, similarly to what happens in the undriven case [103, 104].
In addition, although the magnitude of µ is in general smaller than that of the
thermal conductivity κ, we observe that the influence of µ on the heat transport
could not be considered negligible as the degree of dissipation increases. The α-
dependence of the magnitude of ζU derived from the choice A is plotted in Fig. 4.7
for several values of the volume fraction. It is quite apparent that the influence
of dissipation on |ζU | is more significant than in the case of µ, specially at large

4.4.1     Comparison with stochastic thermostat data

In the present Subsection we compare our theoretical predictions in the case of a
simple stochastic thermostat, (β = 0), with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations
carried out by Vollmayr-Lee, Aspelmeier, and Zippelius [54]. In that paper, time-
delayed correlation functions of a homogenous granular fluid of hard spheres (d =

3) at intermediate volume fractions driven by means of a stochastic external force
were determined. In the steady state, the dynamic structure factor S(k, ω) (being
k the wave number and ω the angular frequency) is measured for several values
of the volume fraction φ and the coefficient of restitution α. The corresponding
best fit of the simulation results of S(k, ω) allowed them to identify the thermal
diffusivity DT and the longitudinal viscosity νl coefficients for the smallest values
of k. As in the simulations performed by Gradenigo et al. [55], this kind of fits
require k-dependent transport coefficients because they consider wave numbers
outside the hydrodynamic regime. As a consequence, their simulation results may
not be well-described by our theory, which is based in the limit of k → 0. This can
be easily seen in Fig. 4.8 where the thermal diffusivity DT is shown as a function of
the volume fraction φ for α = 0.9 and 0.8. For the sake of comparison with those
results, the same units are taken here, that is, m = σ = T = 1. Solid and dashed
lines are the theoretical predictions for DT obtained by using Eqs. (4.37)–(4.39)
(thermostat A) and Eq. (D.1) (thermostat B) respectively. The dotted line refers
to the theoretical prediction for an undriven gas [107]. Symbols refer to simulation
results.

    In general, all theories reproduce the main trends of simulation data. However,
at a more quantitative level, we observe that, in principle, thermostat B agrees with
simulations better than the one corresponding to thermostat A. As we said before,
the discrepancies with our results derived for thermostat A could be explained by
the fact that simulation results were obtained for finite wave number values. Thus,
an inspection of Table II and Fig. 15 in Ref. [54] may help us to figure out that
correct results should be nearer to our theoretical predictions with thermostat A
as k → 0.



4.5        Linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic
           equations

In this Section we study the stability of the hydrodynamic equations for a dense
granular gas with thermostat. The closed hydrodynamic equations for n, U, and
T can be obtained by replacing the constitutive forms of the pressure tensor (4.31),

    In Eq. (4.59) we have assumed ∆U = U − Ug = 0 for the sake of simplicity.
Note that consistency would require to consider up to second order in the gra-
dients in the expression (4.44) for the cooling rate, since this is the order of the
terms in Eqs. (4.31) and (4.32) coming from the pressure tensor and the heat flux,
respectively. However, it has been shown for a dilute gas that the contributions
from the cooling rate of second order are negligible [31] as compared with the
corresponding contributions from Eqs. (4.31) and (4.32). It is assumed here that
the same holds in the dense case [32].

    The form of the NS Eqs. (4.58)–(4.60) for a driven granular fluid is analogous
to that of an ordinary fluid, except for the presence of the external bath parameters
γb and ξb2 , the contributions to the cooling rate ζ (0) and ζU and the new transport
coefficient µ in the energy balance equation. In addition, as shown in Sec. 4.3 and
depending on the values of the coefficient of restitution α, the transport coefficients
are in general different from those obtained for elastic collisions.

    Eqs. (4.58)–(4.60) can be linearized around the stationary homogeneous state,
where the hydrodynamic fields take the steady values ns ≡ const., Ts ≡ const. and
Us = 0. A linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic Eqs. (4.58)–(4.60) has
also been carried out in Ref. [55] but neglecting any dependence of the transport
coefficients on inelasticity and assuming that µ = ζU = 0. As mentioned in
the Introduction, the only impact of inelasticity on the hydrodynamic equations
[55] is through the α-dependence of the (steady) granular temperature Ts [see
Eq. (4.2) with a2,s = 0]. Thus, it is worth to assess to what extent the previous
theoretical results [55] are indicative of what happens when the correct expressions
for the transport coefficients and the cooling rate are considered. This is the main
motivation of this Section.

    We assume that the deviations δyα (r, t) = yα (r, t) − ysα (t) are small, where
δyα (r, t) denotes the deviations of n, U, and T from their values in the steady

undriven case, let us consider the following (reduced) time and space variables:
                                           r
                              1                Ts              1
                           τ = ns σ d−1           t,       r0 = ns σ d−1 r.                   (4.61)
                              2                m               2

The dimensionless time scale τ is a measure of the average number of collisions
per particle in the time interval between 0 and t. The unit length introduced in
the second equality of (4.61) corresponds to the mean free path of gas particles.

    A set of Fourier transformed dimensionless variables is then introduced by

                          δnk (τ )                δUk (τ )                       δTk (τ )
              ρk (τ ) =            ,    wk (τ ) = p        ,         θk (τ ) =            ,   (4.62)
                            ns                      Ts /m                          Ts

where δykα ≡ {ρk , wk (τ ), θk (τ )} is defined as
                                           Z
                                                             0
                             δykα (τ ) =       dr0 e−ik·r δyα (r0 , τ ).                      (4.63)

Note that in Eq. (4.63) the wave vector k is dimensionless.

   In Fourier space, as expected, Eq. (4.59) shows that the d−1 transverse velocity
components wk⊥ = wk − (wk · k)   bkb (orthogonal to the wave vector k) decouple
from the other three modes and hence can be obtained more easily. Their evolution
equation can be written as

The solution to Eq. (4.64) is

                            wk⊥ (k, τ ) = wk⊥ (0) exp [Λ⊥ (k)τ ] ,                            (4.66)

where

Since the (reduced) shear viscosity coefficient η ∗ is positive, then Λ⊥ (k) becomes
negative for any finite wave number k and so the transversal shear modes of the
driven gas are linearly stable. This result contrasts with the ones obtained in the
Chapter 4. Transport properties for driven granular fluids in situations close to
homogeneous steady states                                                        72

unstable for values of k smaller than a certain critical wave number.

by a stochastic thermostat (γb = 0 but γb Tb = finite and ζ0∗ = ξ ∗ ) [53].

One of the longitudinal modes (the heat mode) could be unstable for k < kh ,
where kh is obtained from Eq. (4.74) when Λ = 0, namely, C(kh ) = 0. The result
is

                                          Cρ DT∗ − µ∗
On the other hand, an analysis of the dependence of kh2 on the coefficient of
restitution α and the volume fraction φ shows that kh2 < 0 for any value of α
and φ. Thus, there are no physical values of kh for which the heat mode becomes
unstable. Consequently, all the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix M have a
negative real part and no instabilities are found due to the presence of the external
bath. This conclusion agrees with the results obtained in Refs. [53] and [55] for
driven granular fluids. To illustrate this behaviour Fig. 4.9 shows the dependence
of the real parts of the eigenvalues of the matrix M on the wave number k. It
appears that Re Λ ≤ 0 for any value of k.

     In summary, the results obtained here including the complete α-dependence
of the transport coefficients show no new surprises relative to the earlier works
[53, 55], by considering the elastic Enskog expressions for the above coefficients.
Of course, the quantitative forms for the dispersion relations can be quite different
in both (elastic and inelastic) approaches since the impact of dissipation on the
transport coefficients and the cooling rate is significant and so, their functional
forms differ appreciably from their elastic forms.



4.6      Summary and Discussion

In this Chapter, we have determined the transport coefficients of a granular fluid
driven by a stochastic bath with friction. The results have been obtained within
the framework of the (inelastic) Enskog kinetic theory and they are expected to
apply over a wide range of densities. Our goal is not only academic since, from a
practical point of view, many of the simulations reported [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48,
49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55] for flowing granular materials have used external driving
forces to fluidize the system. For this reason, it would be convenient to provide
the corresponding expressions of the transport coefficients when the granular fluid
is heated by a thermostat. In fact, due to the lack of the above expressions, in
most of the cases it is assumed that the forms of the transport coefficients of
the driven granular fluid are the same as those given by the elastic Enskog theory
Chapter 4. Transport properties for driven granular fluids in situations close to
homogeneous steady states                                                        75

[145]. However, as expected from previous theoretical works [106, 107], the present
results show again that the expressions for the transport coefficients clearly differ
from those obtained for ordinary fluids so that, one should use the true inelastic
Enskog coefficients to analyze granular flows driven by thermostats.

    The transport processes considered are those for a driven fluid with small spa-
tial gradients of the hydrodynamic fields. In this situation, the Enskog equation
has been solved by means of the CE method [105] up to the first order in the spatial
gradients. Since these gradients have been assumed to be independent of the coef-
ficient of restitution, although the corresponding hydrodynamic equations restrict
their applicability to first order in gradients, the transport coefficients appearing
in these equations are valid a priori for an arbitrary degree of dissipation.

    An important but subtle point is the generalization of the driving external
forces (which are mainly used in homogeneous situations) to non-homogeneous
states. This is a crucial step since one has to consider situations close to steady
homogeneous states to determine the transport coefficients from the CE expan-
sion. Although the above generalization is a matter of choice, it has important
implications in the final expressions of the transport coefficients. For simplicity,
in previous works on heated granular gases [106, 107] it was assumed that the
external driving force has the same form as in the homogeneous case, except that
their parameters are local quantities. As a consequence, the parameters of the
force are chosen to impose a stationary temperature in the zeroth-order solution
       (0)
(i.e., ∂t T = 0). However, for general small perturbations around the steady
homogeneous state, it is expected that the density and temperature are specified
separately in the local reference state f (0) and so, the temperature cannot be sta-
                                            (0)
tionary at any point of the system (i.e., ∂t T 6= 0). This choice is more general
                           (0)
than the previous one (∂t T = 0) and has the advantage of a simpler implemen-
tation on computer simulations since the parameters of the driven external force
are constant, even for non-homogeneous states.
                     (0)
    The fact that ∂t T 6= 0 gives rise to conceptual and practical difficulties
not present in the case of the choice B. One of them is that evaluation of the
complete nonlinear dependence of the transport coefficients on dissipation requires
in principle the analysis of the hydrodynamic behavior of the unsteady reference
state. This involves the corresponding numerical integration of the differential
equations obeying the velocity moments of the zeroth-order distribution f (0) [see
for instance, Eq. (4.15) for the fourth degree moment a2 of f (0) ]. This is quite an

intricate problem. However, given that here we are interested in the evaluation
of the momentum and heat fluxes in the first order of the deviations from the
steady reference state, the transport coefficients must be determined to zeroth
order in the deviations. As a consequence, the steady-state condition (3.8) applies
and the transport coefficients and the cooling rate can be defined in terms of the
hydrodynamic fields in the steady state. Explicit expressions for these quantities
have been obtained after considering the leading terms in a Sonine polynomial
expansion. These explicit forms have been displayed in Sec. 4.3 and Appendix
D for the choices A and B, respectively. More specifically, in the case of the
choice A, the bulk λ and shear η viscosities are given by Eqs. (4.33) and (4.35),
respectively, the thermal conductivity κ is given by Eqs. (4.37) and (4.39), the
coefficient µ is given by Eqs. (4.42) and (4.43) and the cooling rate ζ is defined by
Eqs. (4.44)–(4.49). All these expressions clearly show the complex dependence of
the set {λ, η, κ, µ, ζ} on the granular temperature T , the coefficient of restitution
α, the solid volume fraction φ and the model parameter ξb2 . In the case of the
choice B, our results show that the expressions of λ and η are the same as those
obtained from the choice A but the forms of κ and µ are different [they are given by
Eqs. (D.1) and (D.2), respectively]. An important drawback of the results derived
from the choice B is that the coefficient µ can be negative (see Fig. 4.6), although
its magnitude is very small.

    A comparison with recent Langevin dynamics simulations [55] carried out for
a granular fluid driven also by a stochastic bath with friction has been made
in Sec. 4.4. The comparison has been displayed in Fig. 4.3 for the kinematic
viscosity ν, Fig. 4.4 for the longitudinal viscosity νl and Fig. 4.5 for the thermal
diffusivity DT . It is quite apparent that while the predictions of the driven kinetic
theory compares very well with simulation data for ν in a wide range of densities,
some discrepancies appear in the cases of νl and DT as the gas becomes denser.
Surprisingly, in the case of DT , the comparison agrees better when one uses the
elastic form of DT in the more inelastic system (α = 0.6) studied. We think
that this disagreement is in part due to the fact that while the simulation data
have been obtained for small but finite values of the wave number k, the Enskog
expressions for the transport coefficients only strictly apply in the limit k → 0.
Moreover, given that these discrepancies appear at sufficiently high densities, it
could also reflect the limitations of the Enskog equation (which is based on the
molecular chaos hypothesis) as the granular fluid becomes denser.

    For the sake of completeness we have compared our predictions of the ther-
mal diffusivity for hard spheres under the action of a simple stochastic thermostat
(without friction) with recent MD simulations carried out by measuring the dy-
namic structure factor and fitting their numerical data for the dynamical correla-
tions of the longitudinal modes [54]. It is quite apparent that the results derived
from the choice B agree better with simulation data than those obtained from the
choice A. Although this discrepancy could be seen as an important drawback of
our theory it is neccessary to emphasize that our theoretical predictions (both for
choices A and B) only hold in the limit of small gradients, that is, when k → 0
and the simulations were carried out for finite values of k. More simulation data
for small values of k are needed to asses the accuracy of our theoretical results.

    With these new expressions for the momentum and heat fluxes and the cooling
rate, a closed set of hydrodynamic equations for situations close to homogeneous
steady states has been derived. A stability analysis of these linearized hydrody-
namic equations with respect to the homogeneous steady state has been carried
out to identify the conditions for stability in terms of dissipation. Our results show
that the driven homogeneous state is stable for any value of dissipation at suffi-
ciently long wavelengths. This conclusion agrees with previous findings [53, 55]
obtained by using the elastic expressions of the transport coefficients.

Navier-Stokes transport
coefficients for driven inelastic
Maxwell models




5.1      Introduction

As shown in Chapter 4, the determination of the transport coefficients of an in-
elastic driven granular gas involves the evaluation of certain collision integrals [see
Eqs. (C.4), (C.11) and (C.18)]. However, these integrals cannot be exactly cal-
culated because the collision rate is proportional to the magnitude of the relative
velocity of the two colliding pairs. A possible way of circumventing the above
technical difficulty, as for the elastic collisions case [184], while keeping the struc-
ture of the Boltzmann collision operator is to consider the inelastic Maxwell model
(IMM) for a low-density granular gas. For Maxwell particles the collision rate is
independent of the relative velocity and thanks to this the collisional moments
of the Boltzmann operator for IMM can be exactly obtained without the explicit
knowledge of the velocity distribution function [117]. Inelastic Maxwell models
were introduced in granular literature [118, 119, 120] as an altenative to IHS for

assessing in a clean way the influence of dissipation on the dynamic properties of
dilute granular gases.

    As seen early, IMM share with dilute elastic Maxwell molecules the property
that the collision rate is independent of the relative velocity of the two colliding
particles but, on the other hand, obeys the collision rules of IHS. Although IMM do
not represent any physical microscopic interaction potential, the cost of sacrificing
physical realism can be compensated by the availability of exact analytical results.
This fact has stimulated the use of IMM in the past few years [see for instance
Refs. [118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132,
133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 139, 140, 141]). In addition, inelastic particle collisions
can be introduced in the framework of the Boltzmann equation at the level of the
cross section, without any reference to a specific interaction potential [109]. On
the other hand, apart from its academic interest, it is worthwhile remarking that
experiments for magnetic two-dimensional grains with dipolar interactions in air
are well described by IMM [110].

    The goal of this Chapter is to re-examine the problem studied in Chapter 4
by considering the Boltzmann equation for IMM. The use of this model allows us
to determine the expressions of the NS transport coefficients of a driven granular
gas without taking any additional and sometimes uncontrolled approximations.

    Moreover, the comparison between the results obtained from IMM with those
derived from IHS can be used again as a test to assess the reliability of IMM
as a prototype model for charaterizing real granular flows. Previous comparisons
have shown a mild qualitative agreement in the freely cooling case [113, 114] while
the agreement between IMM and IHS significantly increases for low order velocity
moments in the case of driven states (for instance, the simple shear flow problem)
[18, 115, 116, 185].

    As we will show below, the explicit dependence of the transport coefficients of
a driven granular gas on the parameters of the system requires in general to solve
numerically a set of nonlinear differential equations. However, those equations be-
come simple alebraic equations when steady states are considered. An interesting
consequence of using IMM instead of IHS is that a velocity moment of order k
of the Boltzmann collision operator only involves moments of order less or equal
than k. This property allows to get exact solutions for the Boltzmann equation
and justifies the interest in IMM in the last years [138]. In this Chapter the exact
Chapter 5. Navier-Stokes transport coefficients for driven inelastic Maxwell
models                                                                                                81

forms of the shear viscosity η, the thermal conductivity κ and the transport co-
efficient µ are determined as a function of the coefficent of restitution α and the
thermostat parameters. As in the study of IHS case of the previous Chapter, the
expressions of the transport coefficients are obtained by solving the Boltzmann
equation for IMM up to first order in the spatial gradients by means of the CE
expansion [105]. Again it has been taken into account that the zeroth-order distri-
bution function f (0) is not in general a stationary distribution since the collisional
cooling cannot be compensated locally by the energy supplied by the thermostat.
Such energy unbalance introduces new contributions to the transport coefficents
which not were considered in previous works [106, 107] where local steady state
was assumed at zeroth-order.



5.2      Inelastic Maxwell Models

IMM are the starting point in this Chapter to determine the NS transport co-
efficients of a granular inelastic gas driven by stochastic and friction forces. The
Boltzmann equation for a driven granular gas modeled as a Maxwell gas of inelastic
particles is given by Eq. (2.6), namely,

                      γb ∂       γb     ∂    1 ∂2
    ∂t f + v · ∇f −        · Vf − ∆U ·    f − ξb2 2 f = JIMM [f, f ] ,                             (5.1)
                      m ∂v       m     ∂v    2 ∂v

where the collision operator JIMM is
                           Z         Z
                ν(r, t)
JIMM [f, f ] =                 dv2        σ [α−1 f (r, v10 , t)f (r, v20 , t)−f (r, v1 , t)f (r, v2 , t)].
                                         db
               n(r, t)Ωd
                                                                                                   (5.2)
Here Ωd = 2π d/2 /Γ(d/2) is the total solid angle in d dimensions and the collision
frequency ν(r, t) is independent of velocity but depends on space and time through
its dependence on density and temperature. This frequency can be considered as
a free parameter of the model that can be chosen to optimize the agreement with
some property of interest of the original Boltzmann equation for IHS. Moreover,
in order to capture in an effective way the velocity dependence of the original
IHS collision rate, one usually assumes that the IMM collision rate is proportional
to T q with q = 21 . We take q as a generalized exponent so that different values
of q can be used to mimic different potentials. As in previous works on IMM
[115, 116, 185], we will assume that ν ∝ nT q , with q ≥ 0. The case q = 0 is closer
Chapter 5. Navier-Stokes transport coefficients for driven inelastic Maxwell
models                                                                            82

to the original Maxwell model of elastic particles while the case q = 12 is closer to
hard spheres. Thus, the collision frequency can be written as [138]

                                     ν = AnT q ,                                (5.3)

where the value of the quantity A will be chosen later.

     The macroscopic balance equations for density, momentum, and energy follow
directly from Eq. (5.1) by multiplying with 1, mv, and 12 mv 2 and integrating over
v. The result is the same as in Chapter 2, Eqs. (2.14)–(2.16), where the pressure
tensor P and the heat flux q are given by Eqs. (2.20) and (2.21), respectively. The
cooling rate ζIMM is defined by Eq. (3.3).

     Note that the balance equations apply regardless of the details of the interac-
tion model considered. The influence of the collision model appears through the
α-dependence of the cooling rate and of the momentum and heat fluxes.

     One of the main advantages of using IMM instead of IHS is that the collisional
moments of JIMM can be exactly computed. The first few collisional moments of
JIMM are provided in Appendix E. In particular the cooling rate ζIMM can be
determined by taking the trace in Eq. (E.1). It is exactly given by [113]

                                           1 − α2
                                  ζIMM =          ν.                            (5.4)
                                             2d

Note that while in the case of IHS, the cooling rate ζIMM is also expressed as a
functional of the hydrodynamic fields, ζIMM is just proportional to ν in the case of
IMM.

     In order to compare the results derived here for IMM with those obtained
[111] for IHS, we now need a criterion to fix the parameter ν [or the quantity
A in Eq. (5.3)]. As in previous works on IMM [18, 113, 114, 115, 117, 138], an
appropriate choice to optimize the agreement with the IHS results is to take ν
under the criterion that the cooling rate of IMM [as given by Eq. (5.4)] with
q = 21 be the same as the one obtained for IHS of diameter σ evaluated in the
Maxwellian approximation [148, 151]. With this choice, the collision frequency ν
is

                                    ν=       ν0 ,                               (5.5)

5.3       Homogeneous steady states

Before analyzing non-homogeneous states, it is quite convenient first to study the
homogeneous problem. In this case, the density n is constant, the flow velocity
vanishes and the temperature T (t) is spatially uniform. Consequently, the Boltz-
mann equation (5.1) becomes

                              γb ∂       1 2 ∂2
                       ∂t f −      · vf − ξb 2 f = JIMM [f, f ].                            (5.7)
                              m ∂v       2 ∂v

Since the heat flux vanishes and the pressure tensor is diagonal (Pij = pδij , where
p = nT for a dilute granular gas), then the energy balance equation (2.16) reads
simply
                                         2T
                              ∂t T = −      γb + mξb2 − ζIMM T.                             (5.8)
                                         m

    Following the same steps as in Chapter 3, Eq. (5.7) can be written in terms of
the scaled steady distribution function ϕs (c, ξs∗ ). The result is

                    1 ∗          ∗ ∂        1 ∗ ∂2
                      (ζIMM,s − ξs ) · cϕs − ξs 2 ϕs = J ∗ [ϕs , ϕs ],                      (5.9)
                    2               ∂c      4 ∂c
       ∗
where ζIMM,s ≡ ζIMM,s /νs = (1−α2 )/2d, ξs∗ = mξb2 /Ts νs , J ∗ [ϕs , ϕs ] ≡ v0d JIMM [fs , fs ]/(ns νs )
and νs = Ans Tsq . Here, as before, the subindex s means that all the quantities are
evaluated in the steady state.

    As already noted in Chapter 3, the scaled distribution ϕs depends on the
granular temperature through the scaled velocity c and also through the (reduced)
noise strength ξs∗ .

    In reduced units, the steady state condition (∂t T = 0) yields

                                      2γs∗ = ξs∗ − ζIMM,s
                                                    ∗

where γs∗ ≡ γb /(mνs ). Since γs∗ is positive definite, then Eq. (5.10) requires that

ξs∗ ≥ ζIMM,s . Thus, at a given value of α, there is a minimum threshold value
 ∗         ∗
ξth (α) = ζIMM,s needed to achieve a steady state. In particular, for spheres (d = 3),
                       ∗
the smallest value of ξth (α) is 1/6 (which corresponds to α = 0) while the smallest
          ∗
value of ξth (α) for disks (d = 2) is 1/4.

    In the absence of friction (γb = 0), the steady state condition (5.10) becomes
       ∗
ξs∗ = ζIMM,s and Eq. (5.13) yields back the results of the theory of a driven granular
gas heated only by the stochastic thermostat [113], i.e.,

                                       6(1 − α)2 (1 + α)
                       a2,s =                                    .               (5.14)
                              12d + 9 − α(4d + 17) + 3α2 (1 − α)

Moreover, when ξs∗ = 0, Eq. (5.13) is consistent with the one obtained for IMM in
the freely cooling case [113].

    Fig. 5.1 shows the steady value of the fourth-cumulant a2,s versus the coefficient
of restitution α for a three-dimensional system. The theoretical results derived here
for IMM given by Eq. (5.13) and in Ref. [165] [see Eq. (G.7)] for IHS are compared
with those obtained by numerically solving the Boltzmann equation for IMM and
IHS by means of the DSMC method [162]. The parameters of the simulations for
IMM and IHS have been chosen to get ξs∗ = 0.62 in the steady state. It appears
that the homogeneous state of IMM deviates from the gaussian distribution ϕM (c)
(which corresponds to a2 = 0) slightly more than the homogeneous state for IHS.
This behavior contrasts with the results obtained in the freely cooling case [113]
where the magnitude of a2,s for IMM is much larger than that of IHS. As expected,
the simulation data for IMM show an excellent agrement with the exact result
(5.13), even for quite small values of α.



5.4      Chapman-Enskog method for states close to
         homogeneous steady states

Let us slightly disturb the homogeneous steady state by small spatial pertur-
bations. In this case, the momentum and heat fluxes are not zero and their

corresponding transport coefficients can be identified. The evaluation of these co-
efficients as functions of the coefficient of restitution and the parameters of the
external force is the main goal of the present Section.

    As long as the spatial gradients keep small, the Boltzmann equation (5.1)
may be solved by means of the CE method [105] adapted to inelastic collisions.
Since the procedure to obtain the kinetic equations for the zeroth- and first-order
approximations f (0) and f (1) is similar to those made in Chapter 4 for IHS, only
some intermediate steps will be displayed in this Section.



5.4.1        Zeroth-order approximation

The zeroth-order approximation f (0) obeys the kinetic equation:

                           ∂f (0) γb ∂            1 ∂2
                       
        2     m 2
−         γb − ξb + ζIMM T       −      · Vf (0) − ξb2 2 f (0) = JIMM [f (0) , f (0) ].
        m     T             ∂T     m ∂v           2 ∂v
                                                                             (5.15)
As already noted in the case of IHS in Chapter 4, since density and temperature
are specified separately in the local reference state f (0) , the collisional cooling and
the action of the thermostats do not in general cancel each other at all points in
                       (0)
the system. Thus, ∂t T 6= 0 and f (0) depends on time through its dependence on
the temperature.

    In addition, although γb and ξb2 can be considered in general as independent
parameters, we will assume, analogously to the procedure for IHS in Chapter 4,
that both parameters are related by Eq. (4.8). In dimensionless form, Eq. (4.8)
can be written as
                                γ ∗ = βT ∗ ξ ∗ = θξ ∗q/(1+q) ,                    (5.16)

where γ ∗ = γb /mν, T ∗ ≡ T /Tb and
                                                     1/(1+q)

Upon writing Eq. (5.16), use has been made of the identity βT ∗ = θ/ξ ∗1/(1+q) ,
where

    Under unsteady state, dimensional analysis requires that the zeroth-order dis-
tribution f (0) (r, v, t) has the scaled form (4.10) [once one uses the relation (5.16)],
namely
                          f (0) (r, v, t) = n(r, t)v0 (r, t)−d ϕ (c, θ, ξ ∗ ) ,             (5.19)

where now c ≡ V/v0 , V = v − U being the peculiar velocity. The temperature
dependence of the reduced distribution ϕ is encoded by the dimensionless velocity
c and the (reduced) noise strength ξ ∗ . Consequently, according to Eq. (5.19), one
gets

where use has been made of the identity (5.16).

    An implicit expression of the fourth-cumulant a2 (ξ ∗ ) [defined by Eq. (5.11)]
can be obtained for unsteady states by multiplying both sides of Eq. (5.21) by c4
and integrating over velocity. The result is

                                                                           ∗
                                                                               ) − 2ξ ∗ a2 . (5.22)
                                        ∂ξ     d+2


    In Eq. (5.22), the function a2 (ξ ∗ ) must be obtained numerically. As we will
show later, evaluation of the transport coefficients in the steady state requires
the knowledge of the derivatives ∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ and ∂a2 /∂θ in this state. The explicit
expressions of these derivatives are given by Eqs. (G.8) and (G.9) of Appendix G.

(5.19), the term n ∂f∂n can be more explicitly written as

It is worth noticing that for q = 21 , Eqs. (5.23)–(5.28) have the same structure as
that of the Boltzmann equation for IHS [111]. The only difference between both
models lies in the explicit form of the linearized operator L.

    Apart from the above two situations (elastic collisions and undriven granular
gas), the evaluation of the transport coefficients (η ∗ , κ∗ , µ∗ , and e∗D ) for the general
case of unsteady states requires to solve the differential equations (5.35)–(5.37) and

(5.41). However, even for the simplest model (q = 0), it is not possible to obtain
an analytical solution to this system of equations, except in the steady state limit.
For the steady state (Λ∗ = 0), we need still to evaluate the derivatives ∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ and
∂a2 /∂θ. The steady state expressions of these derivatives may be easily deduced,
as we will show, from the simplified steady state form of Eq. (5.22). We present
the results for steady states in the next Subsection.

    The derivatives (∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ )s and (∂a2 /∂θ)s appearing in Eqs. (5.46)–(5.49) can
be easily obtained from Eq. (5.22). According to Eq. (5.22), the derivative ∂a2 /∂ξ ∗

In the steady state, the numerator and denominator of Eq. (5.51) vanish so that,
the quantity ∂a2 /∂ξ ∗ becomes indeterminate. As in the case of IHS, this problem
can be solved by applying l’Hopital’s rule. The final result is

with those derived for IHS [111, 170]. We observe that the discrepancies between
both interaction models are small for not too strong dissipation (say for instance
α & 0.8), although they increase as the coefficient of restitution decreases.

The expressions of the transport coefficients of a driven granular gas of IHS at

the forms of the reduced coefficients ηs∗ , κ∗s , µ∗s and e∗D for a low-density gas (φ = 0)

interested in analyzing the influence of dissipation on transport, the shear viscos-
ity and thermal conductivity coefficients have been reduced with respect to their
                              ∗
corresponding elastic values ηs,0 and κ∗s,0 , respectively. Note that the coefficients
µ∗s and e∗D vanish for elastic collisions. In addition, we have taken β = 12 and the
Maxwell model with the power q = 12 . This latter choice is closer to IHS.

    We observe that in general the qualitative dependence of the transport coef-
ficients on dissipation of IHS is well captured by IMM. The shear viscosity (as
expected because the same behavior is observed in analogous systems [113]) in-
creases with inelasticity. However, this increase is faster for IMM. The (reduced)

thermal conductivity of IHS presents a non-monotonic dependence with dissipa-
tion, since first it decreases as α decreases in the region of weak dissipation, reaches
a minimum and then, the ratio κ∗s /κ∗s,0 increases with inelasticity. This behavior
differs from the one observed for IMM where κ∗s /κ∗s,0 always increases with inelas-
ticity. With respect to the new transport coefficient µ∗s (not present for elastic
collisions), both interaction models predict that this coefficient is much smaller
than the thermal conductivity so that, the impact of the term −µ∇n on the heat
flux q(1) is much smaller than the Fourier’s law term −κ∇T . Notice also that the
quantitative differences between the NS transport coefficients of IMM and IHS
transport coefficients increase with inelasticity, especially in the two-dimensional

tive differences between both models are much less important for driven systems.
Therefore, we think the results in this Chapter are particularly useful also for
studying the transport properties of the analogous IHS driven system.

three different collision integrals to get the explicit forms of the NS transport co-
efficients. However, given that these integrals cannot be exactly evaluated, one
usually considers the leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion of the ve-
locity distribution function (first-Sonine approximation) to estimate them [105].
In spite of the simplicity of this approach, the corresponding expressions of the
NS transport coefficients compare in general quite well with computer simula-
tions. On the other hand, it could be desirable to introduce interaction models
more tractable analytically than IHS that were also capable of capturing the most
important properties of the latter (at least within the domain of velocities near
thermal velocity).

overcome the technical difficulties embodied in the Boltzmann collision operator of
IHS is to consider IMM. In the Boltzmann equation for IMM, the collision rate of
the underlying system of IHS is replaced by an effective collision rate independent
of the relative velocity of the two colliding particles. This property allows us to
evaluate exactly the velocity moments of the Boltzmann collision operator without
the explicit knowledge of the velocity distribution function.

    In this Chapter, the expressions of the transport coefficients of an inelastic
Maxwell gas driven by a stochastic bath with friction have been obtained. As noted
in the Introduction of this Chapter, the evaluation of the transport coefficients of
IMM is an interesting problem by itself since it allows to understand in a clean
way the influence of collisional dissipation on transport properties. In addition,
the comparison between the exact results for IMM with those obtained for IHS by
using approximate analytical methods allows us to gauge the degree of reliability

of IMM for the description of granular flows. Here, we have accomplished this
comparison with the results for IHS derived in Chapter 4 by using the same type
of thermostat.

    The NS transport coefficients have been obtained by solving the Boltzmann
equation for IMM by means of the CE expansion up to first order in the spatial
gradients. As noted in the previous Chapter for IHS, depending on the process,
collisional cooling will not be necessarily balanced at all points in the system by
the thermostat and/or external forces from the boundaries. As a consequence, the
zeroth-order solution f (0) depends on time through its dependence on the granular
                                (0)
temperature. The fact that ∂t T 6= 0 gives rise to conceptual and mathematical
difficulties not present in previous works [106, 113] where the parameters of the
force were chosen to impose a steady temperature in the reference state f (0) . In
particular, we would need to solve numerically (which we have not done in the
present work) a set of coupled first-order differential equations [see Eqs. (5.35)–
(5.37)], in order to obtain the dependence of the transport coefficients on dissi-
pation and the thermostat forces parameters. This technical difficulty is present
even in the simplest Maxwell model where the collision frequency ν is independent
of temperature T [i.e., when q = 0 in Eq. (5.3)]. Thus, the steady state conditions
and analytical expressions of all transport coefficients have been considered. The
steady state expressions are given by Eq. (5.46) for the (dimensionless) shear vis-
cosity η ∗ , Eq. (5.47) for the (dimensionless) thermal conductivity κ∗ , Eq. (5.48) for
the coefficient µ∗ and Eq. (5.49) for the first-order contribution e∗D to the fourth-
cumulant. The three first coefficients provide the momentum and heat fluxes in
the first order of the spatial gradients.

    As in previous works [113, 115, 116], the collision frequency ν appearing in
the Boltzmann equation for IMM [see Eq. (5.2)] has been chosen to reproduce the
cooling rate ζ of IHS (evaluated in the Maxwellian approximation). With this
choice, the comparison between IMM and IHS (see Figs. 5.3–5.6 for d = 2 and 3)
shows that IMM reproduces qualitatively well the trends observed for IHS, even for
strong dissipation. On the other hand, at a more quantitative level, discrepancies
between both interaction models increase with inelasticity, especially in the case
of hard disks (d = 2). In any case, the results found in this work contrast with
those obtained in the freely cooling case [113] where IMM and IHS exhibit much
more significant differences. Thus, the reliability of IMM as a prototype model
for granular flows can be considered more robust in driven states than in the case

of undriven states. This conclusion agrees with the results derived in the case of
the simple shear flow problem [18] and more complex shear-induced laminar flows
[137].

Non-Newtonian hydrodynamics
for a dilute granular suspension
under uniform shear flow




6.1      Introduction

As mentioned in Chapter 1, granular matter can be quite usually found in nature
surrounded by an interstitial fluid (air, water...) in the form of a gas–solid suspen-
sion. At the level of kinetic theory, the description of granular suspensions is an
intricate problem since it involves two phases (solid particles and interstitial fluid)
and hence, one would need to solve a set of two coupled kinetic equations for each
one of the velocity distribution functions of the different phases. However, due
to the mathematical difficulties embodied in this approach and in order to gain
some insight into this problem, a classical model for dilute gas–solid flows is to
consider a single Boltzmann equation for the solid particles where the influence of
the surrounding fluid on them is modeled by means of an effective external force
[78, 79, 187]. This has been the approach considered in the model introduced in
previous Chapters to determine the dynamic properties of a driven granular gas.
    The results obtained in this Chapter have been published in M.G. Chamorro, F. Vega Reyes
and V. Garzó, Phys. Rev. E, 92:052205 (2015) [186]


                                            101
Chapter 6. Non-Newtonian hydrodynamics for a dilute granular suspension
under uniform shear flow                                                         102

    Moreover, in the study of granular suspensions usually only simple states have
been considered, due to the inherent complexity of the system. For instance, in
Ref. [62] the NS transport coefficients of monodisperse gas–solid flows at moderate
densities were obtained by solving a model based on the Enskog kinetic equation
by means of the application of the CE method [105] around the HCS. The external
force Fext proposed in Ref. [62] to model the effect of the fluid phase on grains is
composed by three different terms: (i) a term proportional to the difference be-
tween the mean flow velocities of solid U and gas Ug phases, (ii) a drag force Fdrag
proportional to the velocity of particles and (iii) a stochastic force Fst accounting
for particle neighbor effects (Langevin model).

    As said before, the model introduced in Ref. [62] is quite similar to the one
introduced by Gradenigo et al. [55] for driven granular fluids. In the case that
U = Ug , the coefficient associated with the stochastic force vanishes and only
the drag force interaction Fdrag remains, namely, mean drag and neighbor effects
disappear in the suspension model of Ref. [62]. The above drag force model has
been also recently considered in different papers [188, 189, 190, 191, 192] to study
the shear rheology of frictional hard-sphere suspensions.

    Nevertheless, although there exist cases where the hydrodynamics of granular
gases are Newtonian [13, 193], the ranges of interest fall frequently beyond New-
tonian hydrodynamics since the strength of the spatial gradients is large in most
situations of practical interest (for example, in steady states). This is essentially
due to the coupling between collisional dissipation and spatial gradients that un-
der steady states usually yields moderately large spatial gradients [18, 99, 100]. In
these steady states, a hydrodynamic description is still valid but with constitutive
equations more complex than the NS ones [101, 102]. A very neat example of this
is the simple or uniform shear flow (USF) [194], that except in the quasi-elastic
limit, is essentially non-Newtonian. It is characterized by a linear velocity field
(that is ∂Ux /∂y ≡ a = const), zero heat flux, constant density n and constant
temperature T . In particular, in the USF state the presence of shearing induces
anisotropies in the pressure tensor Pij , namely, nonzero shear stress Pxy and nor-
mal stress differences Pxx − Pyy 6= 0 and Pyy − Pzz 6= 0. In addition, in the case of
granular suspensions, it may be assumed [87, 92] that U = Ug and so, Fext = Fdrag
in the model proposed in Ref. [62].

    A detailed study of simple shear flows of granular suspensions at finite Stokes
numbers was carried out by Tsao and Koch [87] and Sangani et al. [92]. In both
Chapter 6. Non-Newtonian hydrodynamics for a dilute granular suspension
under uniform shear flow                                                          103

of these works, and like in the model used in Ref. [62], suspension dynamics is
dominated by the drag exerted by the fluid (external drag force) and the solid-body
collisions between the particles. In the first paper [87], the authors considered a
dilute gas–solid suspension of elastic particles, thus neglecting the important effect
of inelasticity in macroscopic particles. Inelasticity and excluded volume effects
(moderated densities) were only considered in the second paper [92] of the series.
Moreover, in the first reference [87] (elastic collisions), Tsao and Koch solved the
Boltzmann kinetic equation by means of a Grad’s moment method approach [142]
where the collisional moment Λij of the momentum transfer [see Eq. (6.17) for
its definition] was evaluated by retaining all the quadratic terms in the pressure
tensor Pij (nonlinear Grad’s solution). However, for practical applications, in their
                                                                           2
actual theoretical results only the term proportional to the shear stress Pxy was
retained in the nonlinear contributions to Λij , (see Eqs. (3.14a,b) of [87]). Sangani
et al. [92] solved first the Enskog kinetic equation by means of Grad’s moment
method but only linear terms in the shear rate and the pressure tensor (linear
Grad’s solution) were retained in their calculation of Λij (see Eq. (4.21) of [92]).
Some discrepancies were observed in the very dilute regime for the normal stress
differences. In particular, their linear Grad’s solution yields Pyy = Pzz (see Eq.
(4.33) of [92]) which clearly disagrees with simulation results [92].

    The objective of this Chapter is to offer a complete study of the USF state for
dilute granular suspensions where the effect of the fluid phase on grains is taken
into account by the presence of an external drag force in the kinetic equation. For
the accomplishment of this task, we propose three different approaches: two of
them are theoretical and the third one is computational. In the first theoretical
approach, the Boltzmann equation is solved by Grad’s moment method where both
inelasticity and at the same time all of the non-linear terms in shear rate and stress
tensor are retained in our expression of the collisional moment Λij . Thus, as we
will see, new interesting properties of the suspension arise from this refinement.
For instance, we have been able to detect the influence of both viscous friction
and inelasticity on the normal stress difference Pyy − Pzz . In this sense, our theory
generalizes previous analyses [87, 92], these being recovered when the appropriate
simplifications are applied to it.

    Apart from Grad’s moment method, we also consider a second theoretical ap-
proach based on the derivation of an exact solution to a simplified model kinetic
Chapter 6. Non-Newtonian hydrodynamics for a dilute granular suspension
under uniform shear flow                                                         104

equation [143] for the sheared granular suspension. This will allow us to deter-
mine all the velocity moments of the velocity distribution function as well as the
explicit form of the latter in terms of the shear rate a, the friction coefficient γb
characterizing the drag force and the coefficient of restitution α. In particular,
the rheological properties derived from the model kinetic solution are the same as
those obtained in linear Grad’s solution to the Boltzmann equation.

    As a third route and to gauge the accuracy of the previous analytical re-
sults, we numerically solve the Boltzmann equation for the granular suspension by
means of the DSMC method. In this (exact) numerical solution the grain-grain
collisions in the context of the hard sphere collision model have been taken into
account. As we will see, the comparison between theory and simulation shows that
both (approximate) solutions give in general accurate results even for conditions
of quite strong inelasticity (say for instance, α & 0.5). Moreover, the theoretical
predictions for Pyy and Pzz obtained from our nonlinear Grad’s solution agree very
well with simulations (see Fig. 6.4), showing the improvement of our theory with
respect to the previous analysis of Sangani et al. [92]. On the other hand, the
agreement between theory and simulation becomes worse as the (scaled) friction
coefficient γ ∗ increases. This means that our theory of rapidly sheared granu-
lar flows becomes more reliable as the effects of the inelastic particle collisions
dominate over viscous effects.



6.2      Description of the system

6.2.1     Boltzmann kinetic equation for granular suspensions

Let us consider a set of solid particles of mass m and diameter σ immersed in
a viscous gas. As we already commented, for big enough particles (typical size
. 1 µm), collisions between particles carry a partial loss of their kinetic energy.
Thus, the solid particles can be modeled as a gas of smooth hard spheres (or disks,
for two-dimensional systems) with inelastic collisions.

    In the dilute limit, the corresponding Langevin equation describing the gas–
solid interaction force can be greatly simplified [79, 195]. There are several exper-
imental results on the dynamics of dilute particle systems immersed in a gas flow
Chapter 6. Non-Newtonian hydrodynamics for a dilute granular suspension
under uniform shear flow                                                           105

that validate this kind of approach. For instance, this type of system was ana-
lyzed in early experimental studies where the corresponding flow properties were
carefully measured [83]. These experimental results were later used for validation
of a hydrodynamic theory of a granular suspension immersed in gas flow, allow-
ing for characterization of the relevance of grains collisions in the hydrodynamic
behavior of the turbulent suspension [84]. It has been shown more recently, in
experiments, that the turbulent gas-grain interaction can also be described by a
Langevin equation with a stochastic force that has the form of a white noise, much
in the same way as in classic studies at lower Reynolds number [80]. Therefore,
under the above conditions one can consider the generalized Langevin model for
the instantaneous acceleration on a suspended grain given by Eq. (2.2).

    As mentioned before, this model has been recently proposed in Ref. [62] for
monodisperse gas-solid flows at moderate density. Although the coefficients, ξb2 ,
and γb appearing in Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4), respectively, are in general tensors, in
the case of a dilute suspension they may be simplified as scalars [80]. Those
coefficients are associated with the instantaneous gas-solid force. The first term
is a stochastic model for the change in particle momentum due to shear stress
and pressure contributions at the particle surface that arise from the fluid velocity
and pressure disturbances caused by neighbor particles while the second term
represents the portion of the drag term arising from the mean motion of particle
and solid phase and the fluctuations in particle velocity (relative to its mean value).

    According to the model proposed in Ref. [62], at low Reynolds number, the
expressions of γb and ξb2 for dilute suspensions of hard spheres (d = 3) are, respec-
tively, [62]
                                       1 σ|∆U|2

    In the low-density regime the one-particle distribution function f (r, v, t) pro-
vides complete information on the state of the system. The corresponding Boltz-
mann kinetic equation for dilute granular suspensions is [62]

                        γb      ∂f   γb ∂       1 ∂2
      ∂t f + v · ∇f −      ∆U ·    −      · Vf − ξb2   f = J [f, f ] ,           (6.4)
                        m       ∂V m ∂V         2 ∂V 2

where the Boltzmann collision operator J [v|f, f ] is defined by Eq. (2.12).

    Note that in the suspension model defined by Eq. (6.4) the form of the Boltz-
mann collision operator J[f, f ] is the same as for a dry granular gas and hence,
the collision dynamics does not contain any gas–phase parameter. As it has been
previously discussed in several papers [87, 92, 196], the above assumption requires
that the mean–free time between collisions is much less than the time taken by the
fluid forces (viscous relaxation time) to significantly affect the motion of solid par-
ticles. Thus, the suspension model (6.4) is expected to describe situations where
the stresses exerted by the interstitial fluid on particles are sufficiently small that
they have a weak influence on the dynamics of grains. However, as the density
of fluid increases (liquid flows), the above assumption could be not reliable and
hence one should take into account the presence of fluid into the binary collisions
event.



6.2.2     Steady base state: the uniform shear flow

Let us assume now that the suspension is under steady USF. As we said before,
this state is macroscopically defined by a zero heat flux, constant density n and
temperature T and the mean velocity U is

                             Ui = aij rj ,   aij = aδix δjy ,                    (6.5)

where a is the constant shear rate. The USF state appears as spatially uniform
when one refers the velocity of particles to the Lagrangian frame moving with the
flow velocity U, namely, f (r, v) ≡ f (V), where Vi = vi − aij rj is the peculiar
velocity [57].

    In addition, as usual in uniform sheared suspensions [87, 92], the average
velocity of particles follows the velocity of the fluid phase and so, U = Ug . In this
case, ∆U = 0 and according to Eq. (6.1), ξb2 = 0. Thus, the steady Boltzmann
Chapter 6. Non-Newtonian hydrodynamics for a dilute granular suspension
under uniform shear flow                                                         107

equation (6.4) becomes

                                ∂f    γb ∂
                        − aVy       −      · Vf = J[V|f, f ].                   (6.6)
                                ∂Vx   m ∂V

We note that the Boltzmann equation (6.6) is equivalent to the one employed by
Tsao and Koch [87] (in the case of elastic collisions) and Sangani et al. [92] for
granular suspensions.

    In the USF problem, the heat flux vanishes (q = 0) and the only relevant
balance equation is that of the temperature (2.16). In the steady state and for the
geometry of the USF, Eq. (2.16) reads

                                     2         2T
                                −      Pxy a =    γb + ζ T,                     (6.7)
                                    dn         m

where Pxy and ζ are defined by Eqs. (2.20) and (3.3), respectively.

    Eq. (6.7) implies that in the steady state the viscous heating term (−a Pxy > 0)
is exactly compensated by the cooling terms arising from collisional dissipation
(ζ T ) and viscous friction (γb T /m) [100]. As a consequence, for a given shear rate
a, the (steady) temperature T is a function of the friction coefficient γb and the
coefficient of restitution α. Note that in contrast to what happens for dry granular
gases (γb = 0), a steady state is still possible for suspensions when the particle
collisions are elastic (α = 1 and so, ζ = 0). Moreover, the balance equation (6.7)
also holds for flows with uniform heat flux (the so-called LTu class of Couette
flows) [101, 102, 197] with no friction (γb = 0).

    The USF state is in general non-Newtonian. This can be characterized by
the introduction of generalized transport coefficients measuring the departure of
transport coefficients from their NS forms. First, we define a non-Newtonian shear
viscosity coefficient η(a, γb , α) by

                                    Pxy = −η(a, γb , α)a.                       (6.8)

In addition, while Pxx = Pyy = Pzz = nT in the NS hydrodynamic order, normal
stress differences are expected to appear in the USF state (Pxx 6= Pyy 6= Pzz ). We

normal or diagonal elements Pxx , Pyy and Pzz , where Pij∗ ≡ Pij /p and p = nT is
the hydrostatic pressure. With respect to the cooling rate ζ (which vanishes for

elastic collisions [87]), since this quantity is a scalar, its most general form is

                                  ζ = ζ0 + ζ2 a2 + · · · .                        (6.9)

The zeroth-order contribution to the cooling rate ζ0 was derived in Chapter 4. For
a dilute gas (φ = 0), it is given by

where ν0 is an effective collision frequency of hard spheres defined by (5.6). For
hard spheres (d = 3), Eq. (6.10) is consistent with the results derived by Sangani
et al. [92] in the dilute limit (solid volume fraction φ = 0). On the other hand,
given that the latter theory [92] only retains linear terms in the pressure tensor in
the evaluation of the collisional moment Λij [defined in Eq. (6.17)], then ζ2 = 0.
We calculate the second-order contribution ζ2 to the cooling rate in Sec. 6.3.

    Eq. (6.7) can be rewritten in dimensionless form when one takes into account
Eq. (6.8):
                                   2 ∗ ∗2
                                     η a = 2γ ∗ + ζ ∗ ,                          (6.11)
                                   d
where η ∗ ≡ η/η0 , a∗ ≡ a/ν0 , γ ∗ ≡ γb /(mν0 ) and ζ ∗ ≡ ζ/ν0 . We recall that
η0 = p/ν0 is the NS shear viscosity of a dilute (elastic) gas. Since η ∗ and ζ ∗ are
expected to be functions of the (reduced) shear rate a∗ , the (reduced) friction
coefficient γ ∗ and the coefficient of restitution α, Eq. (6.11) establishes a relation
between a∗ , γ ∗ and α and hence, only two of them can be independent. Here,
we will take γ ∗ and α as the relevant (dimensionless) parameters measuring the
departure of the system from equilibrium.

    Before closing this Subsection, it is instructive to display the results derived
for the granular suspension in the NS domain (small values of the shear rate).
In this regime, the normal stress differences are zero and the form of the shear
viscosity coefficient is [62]

6.2.3     Characteristic time scales and dimensionless num-
          bers

As it is known, in general there is more than one independent reduced length or
time scale in a real flow problem (and, thus, more than one independent Knudsen
number [162]). This feature was analyzed in Ref. [100] in the context of granular
gases. Thus, let us analyze the dimensionless energy balance equation (6.11). It
contains three homogeneous terms, each one of them stands for the inverse of the
three relevant (dimensionless) time scales of the USF problem: the first term is
proportional to the (reduced) shear rate a∗ that, according to its definition, is the
shearing rate time scale (let us call it τshear ); the second term is proportional to
γ ∗ , thus setting the drag friction time scale (τdrag ); and finally, the third one, ζ ∗
comes from the inelastic cooling characteristic time scale (τinelastic ).

    A relevant dimensionless number in fluid suspensions is the Stokes number St
[79]. As in previous works [87, 92], it is defined as the relation between the inertia
of suspended particles and the viscous drag characteristic time scale :

                                              ma
                                     St =          ,                               (6.13)
                                             3πσµg

where we recall that µg is the gas viscosity. According to Eq. (6.2), St can be
easily expressed in terms of γ ∗ and a∗ as

                                                 a∗
                                    St =               ,                           (6.14)
                                            γ ∗ /Rdiss

where Rdiss = 1 for dilute suspensions (φ = 0).

    Since the reduced time scales (τshear , τdrag , and τinelastic ) have been scaled with
the inverse collision frequency ν0−1 , they may be regarded also as the characteristic
Knudsen numbers (Kn) of the system [100]. For this reason, it is a necessary
precondition for a NS hydrodynamic description of the problem (valid only for
small enough spatial gradients), that all of them are small. In other words, as
soon as one of them (just one) is close to one or higher, the NS approximation is
expected to fail [102].

    However, as said before, for the case of the USF regime only two of the relevant
Knudsen numbers are actually independent since they are related through Eq.
(6.11). For this reason, we additionally need to explore the relation between τshear ,

Once the (scaled) non-Newtonian shear viscosity η ∗ and the (scaled) cooling rate
ζ ∗ are given in terms of both α and γ ∗ , one can obtain the (scaled) shear rate
a∗ (or equivalently, the reduced temperature T ∗ ≡ ν02 /a2 = a∗−2 ) by solving the
energy equation (6.15). This yields a cubic equation for T ∗1/2 and has therefore
three roots. A detailed study of the behavior of these roots has been previously
made by Tsao and Koch [87] for elastic suspensions and by Sangani et al. [92] for
inelastic systems. The analysis shows that in general only one root is real at high
values of the Stokes number while the other two are zero and negative (unphysical
solution). We focus now on the physical solution with positive temperature (that
corresponds to the ignited state of [92]) by using the more general nonlinear Grad’s
solution derived in Sec. 6.3.

    In Fig. 6.1 we plot first the surface St(α, γ ∗ ) verifying Eq. (6.15). According to
Fig. 6.1, it is quite evident that it is not possible to reach a null value of the Stokes
number. This is consistent with the energy equation (6.15) since the latter value
would imply St−1 → ∞ and so, a balance between the different effects would not

regions: white stands for the region with a∗ . 1, where the NS description is ex-
pected to apply (or in other words, where non-Newtonian corrections to rheological
properties would not be significant), whereas red stands for the region where the
NS approximation is expected to fail (a∗ & 1). The inelastic time scale τinelastic
would keep small as long as we do not represent too large inelasticity values. The
drag time scale τdrag (or equivalently γ ∗ ) is represented here only below 1. Thus,
the only concern would be tracking small enough values of τshear (or equivalently
a∗ ) values. For this reason, the moderate to large Kn regions in Fig. 6.2(b) are
separated by the curve that follows from the value γ ∗ (α, a∗ = 1) extracted from
Eq. (6.15)

    The dark green region denotes the low St region that is not accessible for
hydrodynamics (negative solutions for T ∗1/2 ). As we can see in both panels (a)
and (b), the agreement between Grad’s solution (which takes into account non-
Newtonian corrections to the shear viscosity) and simulations is excellent as long
as keep in the small Kn region (both γ ∗ < 1 and a∗ < 1).

    The accuracy of Grad’s solution extends deep inside the large Kn region, spe-
cially for lower inelasticities (note the black curve and symbols in the pale red
region of Fig. 6.1). On the other hand, as expected, the NS prediction exhibits
significant discrepancies with simulations when Kn  1.

    Please note that, although this is somewhat masked in the small range of
values of γ ∗ considered in Fig. 6.2(b) the Stokes number St is always a bivalued
function of the (scaled) friction coefficient γ ∗ , as can be clearly seen in Fig. 6.1.
Also notice from Fig. 6.1 that St always has a minimum with respect to γ ∗ (at a
given value of α), although for scale reasons it is not very noticeable in Fig. 6.2.

    It is important to recall again that the need for more complex constitutive
equations (namely, those provided by Grad’s moment method) is not a signal of
a breakdown of hydrodynamics [11, 18], only a failure of the NS approximation
[100, 198].

6.3.1     Grad’s moment method of the Boltzmann equation

We are interested here in obtaining the explicit forms of the relevant elements of
the (scaled) pressure tensor Pij∗ for a dilute granular suspension in terms of a∗ , γ ∗
and α. To get it, we multiply both sides of Eq. (6.6) by mVi Vj and integrate over
velocity. The result is

and we recall that aij = aδix δjy . The exact expression of the collision integral Λij
is not known, even in the elastic case. However, a good estimate can be expected
by using Grad’s approximation [142] where the exact distribution function f is
replaced by                                  m             

is the traceless part of the pressure tensor. Upon writing the distribution function
(6.18) we have taken into account that the heat flux is zero in the USF and we
have also neglected the contribution of the fourth-degree velocity moment to f .
This contribution has been considered in Ref. [156] for the calculation of the NS
transport coefficients of a granular fluid at moderate densities.

    The collisional moment Λij can be determined when Eq. (6.18) is inserted
into Eq. (6.17). After some algebra (see Appendix H for details), we obtain the
expression of Λij for inelastic hard spheres (d = 3) given by

As we noted before, Λij has been evaluated by retaining all the quadratic terms in
the tensor Π∗ij . In particular, Eq. (6.20) reduces to the simpler expression obtained
by Sangani et al. [92] for d = 3 if we suppress the quadratic terms in Π∗ij . Also, if
we particularize Eq. (6.20) for α = 1, we obtain

and hence the expression of Λij derived by Tsao and Koch [87] for the special
case of perfectly elastic particles (see Eq. (3.7) of [87]) is recovered. Thus, the
expression (6.20) for the collisional moment Λij for inelastic hard spheres is more
general and includes the results derived in previous works as particular cases.

    In addition, we have also checked that the expression (6.20) agrees with a
previous and independent derivation of Λij for inelastic hard spheres [199]. This
shows the consistency of our nonlinear Grad’s solution.

    The nonlinear contribution ζ2 to the cooling rate [defined by Eq. (3.3)] can be
obtained for spheres and disks from Eqs. (6.20) and (6.21), respectively. The final
expressions for the dimensionless cooling rate ζ ∗ are

6.3.2     BGK-type kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation

Now we consider the results derived for the USF from a BGK-type kinetic model
of the Boltzmann equation [143]. In the USF problem, the steady kinetic model

     One of the main advantages of using the kinetic model (6.25) instead of the
Boltzmann equation is that it lends itself to get an exact solution. The knowledge
of the form of f (V) allows us to determine all its velocity moments. The explicit
forms of the distribution function f (V) as well as its moments are provided in

6.4      Numerical solutions: DSMC method

As we said in the Introduction, the third method consists in obtaining a numer-
ical solution to the Boltzmann equation (6.6) by means of the DSMC method
[162] applied to inelastic hard spheres. More concretely, the algorithm we used
is analogous to the one employed in Ref. [144] where the USF state becomes ho-
mogeneous in the frame moving with the flow velocity U. Here, we have simply
added the drag force coming from the interaction between the solid particles and
the surrounding interstitial fluid. The initial state is the same for all simulations,
namely, Gaussian velocity distributions with homogeneous density and tempera-
ture. We have observed in most of the cases that, after a relatively short transient,
a steady state is reached. In this state, the relevant quantities of the USF problem

(nonzero elements of the pressure tensor, the kurtosis and the velocity distribution
function) are measured.

    We have performed systematic simulation series for two different situations: (i)
by varying the (scaled) friction coefficient γ ∗ at a given value of α and, conversely,
(ii) by varying the coefficient of restitution α at a given value of γ ∗ . In addition,
the series corresponding to varying γ ∗ have been employed for graphs with varying
the Stokes number St also.



6.5      Results

We devote this Section to direct comparative presentation of the results obtained
from all three independent routes we have followed for this Chapter. Although
the theoretical expressions apply for spheres and disks, for the sake of brevity
we present only results for the physical case of a three-dimensional system (d =
3). Given that the computational algorithm can be easily adapted to disks, a
comparison between theory and simulation for d = 2 could be also performed.

Fig. 6.3 shows the dependence of the (reduced) elements Pxx and Pxy of the pressure
tensor on the Stokes number St. Here, we have performed simulation series by
varying the (reduced) friction coefficient γ ∗ (or equivalently, St) for three different
values of the coefficient of restitution: α = 1 (elastic case), α = 0.7 and α =
0.5. Recall that the diagonal elements of the pressure tensor are related through

Pxx + Pyy + (d − 2)Pzz = d. In this graph, only the predictions given by the
so-called nonlinear Grad’s solution are plotted. The results obtained from linear
Grad’s solution are practically indistinguishable from the latter ones for the cases
considered in this plot. The comparison between theory (solid lines) and computer
simulations (symbols) shows an excellent agreement for all values of the Stokes
number represented here, independently of the degree of inelasticity of collisions
in the granular gas.

that both simulations and theory show that Pzz > Pyy . This is specially relevant
in granular suspensions since we have two different sink terms (γ ∗ and ζ ∗ ) in
the energy balance equation (6.11). And thus, the non-Newtonian effects like
 ∗      ∗
Pyy 6= Pzz are expected to be stronger. The balance of these two terms with the
viscous heating term (η ∗ a∗2 ) requires high shear rates as can be seen in Fig. 6.2.
We observe in Fig. 6.4 that our theory captures quantitatively well the tendency
    ∗
of Pyy (the diagonal element of the pressure tensor in the direction of shear flow)
                        ∗
to become smaller than Pzz , this tendency being stronger as inelasticity increases
(and disappearing completely in the elastic limit α = 1). It is also apparent that
                        ∗       ∗
the dependence of both Pzz and Pyy on the Stokes number is qualitatively well
captured by the nonlinear Grad’s solution, even for strong collisional dissipation.

shows the α-dependence of the relevant elements of the pressure tensor at a given
value of the (scaled) friction coefficient γ ∗ . Since the value of γ ∗ is relatively
high (γ ∗ = 0.5), the results presented in Fig. 6.5 can be considered as a stringent
test for both linear and nonlinear Grad’s solutions. Although the linear Grad’s
solution exhibits a reasonably good agreement with DSMC data, we see that the
nonlinear Grad’s solution mitigates in part the discrepancies observed by using the
linear approach since the former theory correctly predicts the trend of the normal

    Figure 6.6: Plot of the kurtosis K ≡ hV 4 i/hV 4 i0 versus the coefficient of
    restitution α for three different values of the (reduced) friction coefficient γ ∗ :
    γ ∗ = 0 (black line and squares), γ ∗ = 0.1 (blue line and circles) and γ ∗ = 0.5
    (red line and triangles). The solid lines correspond to the results obtained from
    the BGK-type model while symbols refer to DSMC results. The dashed line is
    the result obtained in Ref. [62] for the homogeneous cooling state .


    The dependence of the kurtosis on both γ ∗ and α can be easily obtained
from the results derived from the BGK-type kinetic model [see Eq. (I.11) for the
BGK velocity moments]. Note that hV k i = hV k i0 if one uses Grad’s distribution
(6.18), which is a failure of Grad’s solution since K is clearly different from 1.
Fig. 6.6 shows the dependence of K on the coefficient of restitution α for hard
spheres (d = 3) and three different values of the (reduced) friction coefficient γ ∗ :
γ ∗ = 0 (dry granular gas), γ ∗ = 0.1 and γ ∗ = 0.5. In the case of elastic collisions
(α = 1), K = 1 only for γ ∗ = 0 since in this case the system is at equilibrium
(f = fM ). We have also included the result obtained in Ref. [62] in the HCS,
which is independent of γ ∗ . It is important to remark first that the simulation
results obtained independently here for γ ∗ = 0 in Fig. 6.6 are consistent with those
previously reported for a sheared granular gas with no interstitial fluid [201]. For
low values of γ ∗ , we see that the agreement between theory and simulation is very
good in the full range of values of inelasticities represented here. This shows again
the reliability of the BGK model to capture the main trends observed in granular
suspensions. On the other hand, the agreement is only qualitative for relatively
high values of the friction coefficient γ ∗ since the BGK results clearly underestimate
the value of the kurtosis given by computer simulations. These discrepancies
between the BGK-type model and DSMC for the fourth-degree velocity moment
in non-Newtonian states are not surprising since the above kinetic model does not
intend to mimic the behavior of the true distribution function beyond the thermal

homogeneous state differs clearly from the one obtained in the DSMC simulations
at γ ∗ = 0.

ism) and simulation data is excellent in the region of thermal velocities (|ci | ∼ 1).

6.5.2     Granular suspensions at moderate densities

Although the main results of this Chapter follow from to the study of sheared
granular dilute suspensions described by the Boltzmann kinetic equation (which
strictly applies for zero volume fraction φ = 0), it is interesting to extend them
to the case of moderately dense suspensions. For this regime of densities, the
inelastic Enskog kinetic equation [204] describes the time evolution of the velocity
distribution function.

    Application of Grad’s moment method to the Enskog equation follows similar
steps as those made before for the Boltzmann equation (see Subsection 6.3.1).
On the other hand, the application of this method to dense systems is much
more intricate than for dilute granular suspensions and hence, one has to consider
additional approximations such as to neglect terms that are quadratic or higher
order in the pressure tensor and/or the shear rate. The Enskog kinetic equation
has been recently solved [156] by means of Grad’s moment method to determine
the NS transport coefficients of a d-dimensional dry granular fluid. The forms of
the kinetic Pijk and collisional Pijc contributions to the pressure tensor Pij = Pijk +Pijc

can be easily obtained in the USF problem when one takes into account the results
derived in Ref. [156]. In particular, in the case of hard spheres (d = 3) our
analytical results agree with those reported by Sangani et al. [92] by using previous
results derived by Jenkins and Richman [157] from the classical Grad’s moment
method.

    To compare with the dynamic simulations performed in Ref. [92] for hard

pressure tensor) to the Boltzmann equation, the exact results of the BGK equation
(6.25) with the choice of the free parameter ψ(α) = (1 + α)(2 + α)/6 (which

obtained from the Enskog equation by applying the linear Grad’s moment method.
Symbols are the simulation results obtained by Sangani et al. [92] (circles) and
those obtained here by the DSMC method (triangles).

    We observe first that dynamic simulations [92] and DSMC results are consis-
tent among themselves in the range of values of the Stokes number explored. It
is also important to recall that the (nonlinear) Grad’s solution to the Boltzmann
equation predicts the extinction of the hydrodynamic solution at St/Rdiss ≃ 5

while the prediction of (linear) Grad’s solution to the Enskog equation and the
exact BGK solution is for St/Rdiss ≃ 4.8. Fig. 6.9 shows clearly an excellent
agreement between all the theoretical predictions and both simulation methods.
In fact, as expected the Boltzmann results are practically indistinguishable from
the Enskog ones showing that the density corrections to the rheological proper-
ties are very small for this volume fraction (φ = 0.01). It is also important to
remark the reliability of the BGK model to capture the main trends of the true
Boltzmann kinetic equation. Moreover, given that the suspension is far away from
equilibrium, as expected the NS description fails to describe the dependence of µs
and θ on the Stokes number.

    Concerning the normal stress differences, Fig. 6.10 shows Pxx − Pyy and Pxx −
 ∗
Pzz versus St/Rdiss . Except the nonlinear Grad’s solution to the Boltzmann equa-
tion, all the other theories only predict normal stress differences in the plane
                ∗      ∗     ∗
of shear flow (Pxx 6= Pyy = Pzz ). We observe that the simulations of Ref. [92]
also show that there is anisotropy in the plane perpendicular to the flow velocity
  ∗     ∗
(Pyy < Pzz ), in accordance with nonlinear Grad’s theory. For small Stokes num-
bers, although the different theories overestimate the simulation results, linear
Grad’s solution to the Enskog equation slightly compares better with simulations
of [92] than the more sophisticated nonlinear Grad’s solution to the Boltzmann
equation. Based on the good agreement found in Subsection 6.5.1 for the diagonal
elements of the pressure tensor when the volume fraction is strictly zero, we think
that the disagreement between the nonlinear Grad’s solution and simulations for
φ = 0.01 is due essentially to the (small) density corrections to the above elements
which are of course not accounted for in the Boltzmann equation.

    Finally, Fig. 6.11 shows       θ versus St/Rdiss for two different values of the co-
efficient of restitution: α = 0.7 and α = 0.5. We have considered the DSMC
performed here for α = 0.7 and α = 0.5 and those made in Ref. [92] in the case
α = 0.5. In addition, we have also included the theoretical results derived in
[92] from the Enskog equation. We observe first that the dynamic simulations
for finite Stokes number and the DSMC results are consistent among themselves
in the range of values of St/Rdiss explored. This good agreement gives support
to the applicability of the model for dilute granular suspensions introduced in
Eq. (6.6). It is also apparent that the performance of nonlinear Grad’s theory
for the (steady) temperature is slightly better than the remaining theories. Note

stance, the discrepancies between nonlinear Grad’s theory and DSMC results for

well with simulations for not too large values of the (scaled) friction coefficient γ ∗
(or equivalently, for large values of the Stokes number St).

6.6                     Summary and Discussion

In this Chapter, we have presented a complete and comprehensive theoretical
description of the non-Newtonian transport properties of a dilute granular sus-
pension under USF in the framework of the (inelastic) Boltzmann equation. The
influence of the interstitial fluid on the dynamic properties of grains has been
modeled via a viscous drag force proportional to the particle velocity. This type
of external force has been recently employed in different works on gas-solid flows
[188, 189, 190, 191, 192]. The study performed here has been both theoretical and
computational. In the theory part, we have presented results from two different ap-
proaches: Grad’s moment method and a BGK-type kinetic model used previously
in other granular flow problems and now applied specifically to the model of gran-
ular suspensions. In contrast to previous works in granular sheared suspensions
[92], we have included in Grad’s solution quadratic terms in the pressure tensor Pij
in the collisional moment Λij associated with the momentum transport (nonlinear

Grad’s solution). This allows us to evaluate the normal stress differences in the
                                                                        ∗     ∗
plane normal to the laminar flow (namely, the normal stress difference Pyy − Pzz )
and of course, one obtains more accurate expressions of the non-Newtonian trans-
port properties. The inclusion of quadratic terms in Pij in the evaluation of Λij
was already considered by Tsao and Koch [87] in an analogous system but only in
the limit of perfectly elastic collisions (α = 1).

    Moreover, the development of the corresponding BGK-type model for the
dilute granular suspension under uniform shear has allowed us also to formally
compute all velocity moments as well as the velocity distribution function of the
suspension.

    Additionally, to gauge the accuracy of the above theoretical approaches, we
have presented simulation results (DSMC method applied to the inelastic Boltz-
mann equation). The comparison between theory and DSMC has been done by
Chapter 6. Non-Newtonian hydrodynamics for a dilute granular suspension

varying both the (scaled) friction coefficient γ ∗ (or equivalently, the Stokes number
St) characterizing the magnitude of the drag force and the coefficient of restitution
α characterizing the inelasticity of collisions. The agreement for the reduced shear
rate [see Fig. 6.2 (a)] and the elements of the pressure tensor [see Figs. 6.3 and 6.4]
between DSMC and both theoretical solutions is excellent (especially in the case of
nonlinear Grad’s solution) for not too large value values of γ ∗ . As the magnitude
of the friction coefficient increases the agreement between Grad’s solution and sim-
ulations decreases [cf. Fig. 6.5], although being the discrepancies smaller than 6%.
This good performance of Grad’s method has been also observed for monodisperse
dry granular gases for Couette flow sustaining a uniform heat flux [101, 102, 197]
and also in the case of granular binary mixtures under USF [205, 206]. Regarding
high velocity moments, we also obtain good agreement for the kurtosis K since
the BGK results compare very well with simulations for not too large values of
γ ∗ [cf. Fig. 6.6]. Finally, as expected, the BGK model reproduces very well the

behavior of the marginal distributions ϕx (cx ) and ϕy (cy ) in the region of ther-
mal velocities [see Figs. 6.7 and 6.8], although they quantitatively disagree with
simulations for higher velocities especially for strong collisional dissipation.

Conclusions and Outlooks


7.1      Conclusions

In this work transport properties of a granular gas homogeneously driven by a
thermostat composed by two different external forces (stochastic heating and drag
friction) have been studied. Such forces compensate for the inelastic cooling due to
the binary collisions (inelastic hard spheres, IHS) and the system is maintained in
a non-equilibrium steady state. The Enskog kinetic equation has been considered
as the starting point and DSMC simulations have been carried out to assess the
validity of the theoretical predictions.

    Firstly, the velocity distribution function of a homogeneous system has been
characterized through its first non-zero velocity moments, that is, the Sonine coef-
ficients a2 and a3 defined in terms of the fourth and sixth-degree velocity moments
of the scaled velocity distribution function ϕ. The new feature found here is the
dependence of ϕ on the granular temperature T through both the scaled velocity c
and the (reduced) strength noise ξ ∗ [defined in Eq. (3.11)]. The simulation results
have confirmed the above dependence (see Figs. 3.6 and 3.7).

    The Navier-Stokes transport coefficients have been obtained by solving the
Enskog kinetic equation by means of the Chapman-Enskog expansion. Heat and
momentum fluxes have been determined in first-order deviations of the hydrody-
namic fields from their homogeneous steady state.

    An important point here is the generalization of the driving external forces
(which are mainly used in homogeneous situations) to non-homogeneous states.
                                           131
Chapter 7. Conclusions and Outlooks                                             132

The choice of a general external driving force that homogeneously acts over the
whole system cannot compensate locally the collisional cooling and the local refer-
ence state f (0) depends on time through the non-steady temperature. The above
choice has the adventage of a simpler implementation on computer simulations but
introduces some difficulties in the analytical study. However, given that the knowl-
edge of the complete time-dependence of the transport coefficients is a formidable
task and we are interested in the evaluation of the momentum and heat fluxes in
the first order of the expansion, then the transport coefficients must be determined
to zeroth order in the deviations. As a consequence, the steady-state condition
(3.8) applies and the transport coefficients and the cooling rate can be defined in
terms of the hydrodynamic fields in the steady state. Our theoretical predictions
of the driven kinetic theory compares reasonably well with Langevin dynamics
simulations in a wide range of densities. However, some discrepancies appear in
the cases of νl and DT as the gas becomes denser.

    The stability of the linearized hydrodynamic equations with respect to the
homogeneous steady state with the new expressions for the momentum and heat
fluxes and the cooling rate has been analyzed in order to identify the conditions
for stability in terms of dissipation. Results presented here show that the driven
homogeneous state is stable for any value of dissipation at sufficiently long wave-
lengths.

    The transport coefficients have also been obtained by solving the Boltzmann
equation for inelastic Maxwell models (IMM) by means of the Chapman-Enskog
method. The comparison between IMM and IHS shows that IMM reproduces
qualitatively well the trends observed for IHS, even for strong dissipation. At a
more quantitative level, discrepancies between both interaction models increase
with inelasticity. In any case, the results found in this work contrast with those
obtained in the freely cooling case [113] where IMM and IHS exhibit much more
significant differences. Thus, the reliability of IMM as a prototype model for
granular flows can be considered more robust in driven states than in the case of
undriven states.

    Finally, a complete theoretical description of the non-Newtonian transport
properties of a dilute granular suspension under USF in the framework of the
(inelastic) Boltzmann equation has been presented. In that case, the effect of
the interstitial fluid on the solid particles has been modeled via a viscous drag
force proportional to the particle velocity and a stochastic force accounting for
Chapter 7. Conclusions and Outlooks                                                133

particle neighbor effects (Langevin model) proportional to the difference between
the mean velocity of solid and interstitial fluid respectively. In the USF, the
mean flow velocity of gas phase follows the mean flow velocity of solid particles
and hence, only the drag force and the collisional cooling compensate for the
viscous heating due to shearing work. Here we have used three different but
complementary routes: Grad’s moment method, BGK-type kinetic model and
DSMC computer simulation.

    We have included in Grad’s solution quadratic terms in the pressure tensor Pij
in the collisional moment Λij associated with the momentum transport (nonlinear
Grad’s solution). This allows us to evaluate the normal stress differences in the
                                                                        ∗
plane normal to the laminar flow (namely, the normal stress difference Pyy −
 ∗
Pzz ) and of course, one obtains more accurate expressions of the non-Newtonian
transport properties.

    In the case of inelastic collisions and to the best of our knowledge, this is
                                    ∗     ∗
the first time that the difference Pyy − Pzz has been analytically detected and
evaluated in a theory of sheared granular suspensions. This is one of the most
relevant achievements of the present work.

    The agreement between DSMC and both theoretical solutions for the reduced
shear rate and the elements of the pressure tensor is excellent (especially in the case
of nonlinear Grad’s solution). This shows the accuracy of our analytical results
that allows us to describe in detail the flow dynamics of the granular sheared
suspension. We also obtain good agreement between DSMC and BGK kinetic
model for the kurtosis and the behavior of the marginal distributions in the region
of thermal velocities.



7.2      Outlooks

An interesting point is the usefulness of the theoretical results derived in this work
to modelize the experiments performed by using boundary driven conditions. As
usual in computer simulations, in this work we have fluidized the system by means
of a thermostat composed by a friction term which mimics the presence of an
interstitial fluid and a stochastic force that could model the effect of a vibrating
wall. The main advantage of using this type of driving mechanism is the possibility
of making theoretical progress. In addition, although the relationship of the last
Chapter 7. Conclusions and Outlooks                                                134

external force with real vibrating walls is not clear to date, some theoretical results
(see, for instance Fig. 2 of Ref. [207]) obtained for the temperature ratio of a
granular impurity immersed in a granular gas heated by the stochastic thermostat
compare quite well with MD simulations of shaken mixtures [208]. This agreement
could stimulate the use of this simple stochastic driving for qualitative comparisons
with experimental results. On the other hand, more comparisons between kinetic
theory results for heated granular gases and computer simulations performed in
realistic vibrating beds are needed before qualitative conclusions can be drawn.

    One of the objectives of the present work has been to determine the non-
Newtonian transport properties of a granular suspension under USF. This study
can be considered as the starting point for the deployment of a more comprehensive
and systematic theory for more complex flows. In this context, we expect in the
near future to extend the present results to other related flows such as the so-called
LTu flows [101, 197] (i.e., the more general case of uniform but non-null heat flux)
or to the more general class of Couette flows [102].

    We want also to carry out further studies on the more realistic case of multi-
component granular suspensions where problems like segregation can be addressed.

    Another interesting point here is that the non-linear solution to the Boltzmann
equation proposed in Chapter 6 predicts the existence of a second branch in the
curve for the Stokes number St for high values of the friction coefficient γb (see
Fig. 6.1) not present in previous works [87, 92]. This second branch, which lies for
high Knudsen numbers, could not be reached numerically due to the limitations
of our uniform DSMC simulations. In order to test this branch, new non-uniform
DSMC or MD simulation will be carried out in the future.

A.2         Approximations I and II

The forms of the Sonine coefficients a2 and a3 by using Approximations I and II
are displayed in this Appendix. Let us start by considering Approximation I. In
this case, we neglect a3 versus a2 in equation (3.37) and so, one gets

    Once a2 is determined, we can use equation (3.38) to express a3 in terms of

    In Approximation II, a3 is formally treated as being of the same order of
magnitude as a2 and so, Eqs. (3.37) and (3.38) become a linear set of two cou-
pled equations for a2 and a3 . The problem is algebraically more involved as in

tion follows similar mathematical steps as those made before in the undriven case

f (1) obeys the kinetic equation

   Furthermore, due to the complex dependence of the distribution function f (0)
on the density through χ and ξ ∗ , the derivative ∂f (0) /∂n has now two new terms
not present in previous works:

                        ∂f (0)               ∂f (0) 2 ∂f (0)     ∂χ ∂f (0)

   The solution of Eq. (B.1) can be written in the form:

this first-order distribution function (B.15) in (B.6) and since the gradients of
the hydrodynamic fields are all independent, a set of independent, linear, non-

   In the first order of the deviations from the steady state, we only need to
know the transport coefficients to zeroth order in the deviations (steady state
conditions). This means that the term

appearing in the left-hand side of Eqs. (B.14)–(B.17) vanishes. The differential
equations for the transport coefficients thus become simple coupled algebraic equa-
tions. They are given by Eqs. (4.26)–(4.29).
Appendix C

Kinetic contributions to the
transport coefficients

In this Appendix we determine from Eqs. (4.26)–(4.29) the kinetic contributions
to the transport coefficients η, κ and µ as well as the first order contribution ζU to
the cooling rate. Given that all these coefficients are evaluated in the steady state,
the subscript s appearing along the main text will be omitted in this Appendix
for the sake of brevity.

      We start with the kinetic contribution ηk to the shear viscosity η. It is defined
as:                                             Z
                                     1

To obtain ηk , we multiply Eq. (4.28) by Dij and integrate over velocity. The result

Appendix C. Kinetic contributions to the transport coefficients                  144

The collision integral of the right hand side of Eq. (C.3) has been evaluated in
previous works [103, 104] and the result is:

                               ∂f (0)

                                ∂Vj

Thus, the kinetic part ηk can be written as

                                      2d−2
                                                           
                          nT
                  ηk =             1−      (1 + α)(1 − 3α)φχ .                 (C.6)
                       νη + 2γmb      d+2

In order to get an explicit expression for ηk , one has to evaluate the collision
frequency νη . It can be determined by considering the leading terms in a Sonine
polynomial expansion of the function Cij (V). Here, we have considered a recent
modified version of the standard method [182, 210] that yields good agreement
with computer simulations even for quite strong values of dissipation [211]. The
expression of νη is given by Eq. (4.36). The final form (4.35) of the shear viscosity
η is obtained when one takes into account the relation (4.8).

    The kinetic parts κk and µk of the transport coefficients characterizing the
heat flux are defined, respectively, as

    The expression (C.15) for κk is still exact. In order to get an explicit expres-
sion for κk , one considers the form (4.1) for ζ (0) and evaluates νκ by considering
again the leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion of A(V). With these

neglected the contributions proportional to the derivatives ∂a2 /∂χ and ∂a2 /∂θ.

Expressions for choice B

In this Appendix we display the expressions for the NS transport coefficients η, λ,

κ, and µ by using the choice B defined by the condition ∂t T = 0. The application
of the Chapman-Enskog method to this case follows similar mathematical steps as
                                 (0)
those made for the choice A (∂t T 6= 0). The results show that the expressions of
η and λ are the same as those obtained for the choice A [see Eqs. (4.33)–(4.35)].
However, the forms of κ and µ are different since they are given by Eqs. (4.37)
and (4.42), respectively, but their corresponding kinetic contributions are

Collisional moments of JIMM[f, f ]

As said in the Introduction of Chapter 5, one of the advantages of the Boltzmann
equation for Maxwell models (both elastic and inelastic) is that the collisional mo-
ments of the operator JIMM [f, f ] can be exactly evaluated in terms of the moments
of the distribution f , without the explicit knowledge of the latter [212]. More ex-
plicitly, the collisional moments of order k are given as a bilinear combination of
moments of order k 0 and k 00 with 0 ≤ k 0 + k 00 ≤ k. In particular, the collisional
moments involved in the calculation of the momentum and heat fluxes as well as
in the fourth cumulant are given by [113, 117]

First-order contributions to the

Models

In this Appendix we determine the first-order contributions to the momentum and
heat fluxes for a driven granular gas of IMM. Let us consider each flux separately.

The first order contribution to the pressure tensor Pij is defined by Eq. (5.30).
To obtain it, we multiply both sides of Eq. (5.23) by mVi Vj and integrate over v.

The corresponding differential equations for κ∗ and µ∗ can be obtained when one
takes into account the constitutive form (5.31) and the relations (F.10)–(F.12) in
Eq. (F.6). These equations are given by Eq. (5.36) for κ∗ and Eq. (5.37) for µ∗ .

    We consider finally the isotropic fourth degree moment (5.39). Since eD is a
scalar, it can be only coupled to the divergence of flow velocity ∇ · U:

                                 eD = e∗D ν −1 ∇ · U.                              (F.13)

In order to determine the (reduced) coefficient e∗D , we multiply both sides of Eq.
(3.47) by V 4 and integrate over velocity. After some algebra one arrives to Eq.

The expressions of the NS transport coefficents obtained in Chapter 4 for a mod-
erately dense gas of IHS are displayed in this Appendix in the low-density limit

the thermal velocity. The Gaussian integrals involved in the calculation of Iij can
be easily computed by considering g∗ and G∗ as integration variables instead of
c1 and c2 . The corresponding integrals can be done quite efficiently by using a
computer package of symbolic calculation. Here, we have used MATHEMATICA
[213]. The final expressions of Λij are given by Eq. (6.20) for d = 3 and Eq. (6.21)
for d = 2.

    Once the collisional moment Λij is known, the hierarchy (6.16) can be solved.
According to the geometry of USF, the only non-zero elements of the pressure
tensor are the off-diagonal element Pxy = Pyx (shear stress) and the diagonal
Appendix H. Results from Grad’s moment method. Rheological properties              161

elements Pkk (k = x, y and also z, if d = 3). The equations defining these elements
(including the zz element that would only raise if d = 3) can be easily obtained
from Eq. (6.16). They are given by

                              2a∗ Π∗xy + 2γ ∗ (1 + Π∗xx ) = Λ∗xx ,              (H.11)

                                    2γ ∗ (1 + Π∗yy ) = Λ∗yy ,                   (H.12)

                              a∗ (1 + Π∗yy ) + 2γ ∗ Π∗xy = Λ∗xy ,               (H.13)

where Λ∗ij ≡ Λij /pν. Note that in the physical case d = 3, Π∗zz can be obtained
from the constraint Π∗zz = −(Π∗xx + Π∗yy ).

    The solution to Eqs. (H.11)–(H.13) gives the elements Π∗xx , Π∗yy and Π∗xy as
functions of the reduced shear rate a∗ . Note that a∗ is proportional to the square
root of the (steady) temperature. In order to close the problem, we need an extra
condition to express a∗ in terms of γ ∗ and α. This is provided by the energy
balance equation (6.7), whose dimensionless form is

                                    2
                                   − Π∗xy a∗ = 2γ ∗ + ζ ∗ ,                     (H.14)
                                    d

where ζ ∗ is defined by Eqs. (6.23) and (6.24) for spheres and disks, respectively.
Thus, the solution to Eqs. (H.11)–(H.14) provides the forms of Π∗ij in terms of the
coefficient of restitution α and the (dimensionless) friction coefficient γ ∗ . On the
other hand, given that the collisional moments Λ∗ij are nonlinear functions of Π∗ij ,
Eqs. (H.11)–(H.14) must be solved numerically (nonlinear Grad’s solution).

    An analytical solution to Eqs. (H.11)–(H.14) can be easily obtained when one
only considers linear terms to Π∗ij in the expressions (6.20) and (6.21) for Λij . This
was the approach considered by Sangani et al. [99] to get the kinetic contributions
to the pressure tensor at moderate densities. In this linear approximation (linear
Grad’s solution), the solution to Eqs. (H.11)–(H.14) can be written as

    In the dry granular case (γ ∗ = 0), Eqs. (H.15)–(H.17) are consistent with pre-
vious results [99] obtained in the USF problem by using Grad’s moment method.
In addition, the expressions obtained by Sangani et al. [99] agree with Eqs. (H.15)–
(H.17) in the limit of dilute granular suspensions.

    In order to write more explicitly the form of the (scaled) distribution function
ϕ(V), we consider here a three-dimensional system (d = 3). In this case, the

distribution ϕ can be written as
                     Z ∞
              −3/2
                           dt e−(1−3e)t exp −e2et (cx + e

To illustrate the dependence of ϕ on the parameter space of the problem, it is
convenient to introduce the following marginal distributions:
                                          Z ∞          Z ∞
                            ϕ(+)
                             x (cx ) =           dcy         dcz ϕ(c),                        (I.13)
                                            0           −∞

                                          Z ∞          Z ∞
                            ϕ(+)
                             y (cy ) =           dcx         dcz ϕ(c).                        (I.14)
                                            0           −∞

Their explicit forms can be easily obtained from Eq. (I.12):

In Eqs. (I.15) and (I.16), erfc(x) is the complementary error function.

   So far, ψ has remained free. Henceforth, to agree with the results derived from
linear Grad’s solution, we will take ψ = β, where β is defined by Eq. (H.18).
