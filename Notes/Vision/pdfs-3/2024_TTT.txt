a ranker, called self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023). How-
ever, this is not viable in ARC (where the output grid is
directly predicted) as there is no way to directly enforce
diversity across samples while ensuring coherence within
samples. As an alternative self-consistency approach, we
try an augmented inference strategy that combines greedy
decoding with multiple versions of the input. Specifically,
we generate multiple prediction candidates by using geomet-
ric transformations. We then employ a hierarchical voting
strategy to determine the final prediction from the set of
generated candidates. This approach involves two stages of
voting to progressively narrow down the best candidates: (1)                                                            Figure 6. Performance results across model sizes. Fine-tuned

A.3. Evaluation
We follow the competition rules that if any of the two pass@2 predictions of the system is correct, we consider that test
correct. In the reported task-level accuracies, we did not give partial points if all tests are not solved, except the final table

Figure 11. LLM based synthetic tasks generation: Given some seed task descriptions and task generator functions in Python, we
generate more generator functions to produce novel tasks. We use three different approaches: (1) few-shot prompting with only generators,
(2) few-shot prompting with generators and task descriptions, (3) two-stage approach: first generate free form descriptions, then condition
on them to generate more generators (shown in Figure 12).


B. Fine-Tuning Before TTT
While test-time training facilitates task-specific adaptation, the base model’s capabilities impacts the final performance.
We developed several approaches for generating synthetic training data to enhance the base model’s abstract reasoning
capabilities through fine-tuning, exploring both automated and semi-automated methods for task generation. In this section,
we detail our fine-tuning data generation strategies and analyze the impact of different data sources and model sizes on final
performance.

B.1. Preparing Fine-tuning Data
(Hodel, 2024) provides domain-specific language (DSL), R E ARC, as well as the transformation fi that solves the task-i,
                                                                                                     train
and the data generation function gi that are implemented in this DSL for each training task in the DARC    dataset. These
functions enable sampling of new input-output pairs that maintains the same underlying transformation principle:

                                                                                              d = (x, y) ∼ eval(gi )                                                                         (1)

where d represents a newly generated input-output pair that can be solved using the same transformation function fi as the
original task-i4 .

(a) Using Existing Generators The generator functions g in R E ARC already provide an effective data augmentation tool
by producing different instantiations of same tasks. We generate extra samples from these training tasks by running the code
many times and randomly splitting these new examples (d ∼ eval(gi )) to a set of train and test examples. These augmented
examples are already provided with their DSL release.

(b) Few-shot Prompting an LLM Additionally, we used several approaches to generate novel tasks using an LM (in our
case, an ensemble of GPT4 and GPT4-o).
The simplest approach generates new task generators using few-shot examples:

                                                                                         g ′ ∼ LM(g1 , g2 , . . . , gm )                                                                     (2)

where g ′ is a new generator function and g1 , . . . , gm are existing generator functions (shown in Figure 11). We sample
different m examples by uniformly from existing training set. We repeat this process multiple times to get a good amount of
tasks.
We augment the generator functions with task descriptions and jointly generate both descriptions and generators:

                                                                       (s′ , g ′ ) ∼ LM(s1 , g1 , s2 , g2 , . . . sm , gm )                                                                  (3)

where si represents the description of task i.

       We can verify the generated examples by asserting fi (x) = y.

Figure 12. Two-stage generation using an LLM: First, we prompt the LLM to generate a task description using few-shot prompting.
Then, we generate the new generator based on existing task pairs and the newly created description.


To get the task descriptions, we manually created seed descriptions for 10 training tasks. These seed descriptions were then
used to generate descriptions for the training and validation tasks through few-shot prompting. To increase diversity of
tasks, we use task descriptions with hierarchical fields (category, summary, and description). The process of getting these
descriptions is provided in Appendix D.1.
Instead of jointly generating task descriptions and function generations, we additionally deployed a two-stage approach
(Figure 12 ) described as following:


                                                                                                                         s′ ∼ LM(s1 , s2 , . . . sm )                                                                                                                                                                         (4)
                                                                                                                          ′                                                                                                 ′
                                                                                                                         g ∼ LM(s1 , g1 , s2 , g2 , . . . , sm , gm , s )                                                                                                                                                     (5)
                                                                                                                                    ′
This approach first generates a task description s and then conditions the generator creation on both existing task pairs
and the new description. In total we collected 6426 generators with these LLM based approaches. We provide qualitative
samples from these LM generated tasks in Figure 16.

(c) Geometric Transformations Finally, our synthetic tasks are enhanced through various geometric transformations,
such as basic transformations (rotations, reflections, random shift and size scaling), pattern operations (random patching,
tiling, and repetition), color permutations, and composite transformations involving sequential application of multiple basic
transformations. These transformations are applied in three ways:

   • Input grids only: (x, y) → (t(x), y)
   • Output grids only: (x, y) → (x, t(y))
   • Both input and output: (x, y) → (t(x), t(y))

We use all the transformations given in Appendix C.1, and some additional transformations given in Table 3. In the
fine-tuning case, different from TTT, we apply augmentations to only inputs, only outputs or both. These transformations
are applied randomly to variants of tasks with 30% of the time.

Table 3. We provide the additional augmentations use in our data generation for fine-tuning with their function signature and description.

Figure 13. Left: Accuracy when fine-tuning with different data sources. While all fine-tuned models perform similarly, their
performance after TTT shows considerable variance. As expected, removing geometric transformations from the fine-tuning data reduces
performance compared to the model trained on the full dataset. Surprisingly, excluding LM-generated data from fine-tuning actually
outperforms the model trained on all data. Right: Performance results across different model sizes. As expected, performance of the
base fine-tuned model improves with increasing model size, aligning with current scaling law trends. However, the scaling behavior after
TTT is less clear. For instance, the final performance of the 1B and 3B models is identical after TTT. Full discussion in Section B.3.


B.2. ARC Initial Fine-tuning Hyperparameters
We perform full fine-tuning on LLama-3 family models by using the torchtune library. We train each model up to
16000 steps. We use 2xNVIDIA A100 GPU for 1B models, 4xNVIDIA A100 GPU for 3B and 8B models. We present
hyperparameters in Table 4.

B.3. Results
We perform full fine-tuning 1B, 3B Llama 3.2 instruction-tuned, and 8B Llama 3 instruction-tuned using augmented
data. The format and training objective is same as the ones described for TTT in 3. Hyperparameter details are given in
Appendix C.2. We do the following ablations for augmented data:

  1. No FT: The original Llama 3 instruction-tuned model without any fine-tuning.
  2. All: We use all methods described in Section B.1, including R E ARC, rule-based augmentation, and LM generation.
  3. No-Geom: We remove geometric transformations from all tasks.

  4. No-LM: We only use R E ARC and rule-based augmentation, excluding tasks generated by the LM.

We show results using different model sizes in Figure 13. Increasing the model size consistently improves FT performance,
with the 8B model achieving the highest accuracy of 36%. We also observe that TTT effectively closes the performance gap
for smaller models, with the 1B and 3B models achieving similar accuracy after TTT.

Figure 14. TTT dataset generation for a test task (Section 3.1): We start by creating leave-one-out tasks from the given training
examples of the task. These tasks are then augmented through rule-based transformations to obtain the full TTT dataset. Finally, we train
task-specific LoRA adapters on top of the base FT model.




C.1. Transformations
We provide the augmentations used in TTT in Appendix C.1, please refer to our code base for their implementations. After
applying these augmentations, we additionally shuffle colors and shuffle training examples. Note that these transformations
are applied to all input and output grids. The procedure for generating the dataset for TTT is shown in Figure 14.

C.2. Training Setup & Hyperparameters
We use the torchtune(torchtune Maintainers & Contributors, 2024) library to train LoRA adapters on Llama-3 family of
models. We apply LoRA training to query and value projection weights of the self-attention layer, to the MLP weights and to
the output projection layer (was only available for Llama-3 8B in torchtune). We present hyperparameters of this training
in Table 6. We also found that using quantized LoRA adapters (Dettmers et al., 2023) instead of standard (full-precision)
LoRA leads to only a small drop in performance (29 → 26 tasks solved with the 1B-parameter model), making it a viable
option in memory-constrained settings.
We resort to the vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) library for prediction as it provides fast kernels and batched inference for our
models and LoRA inference. We just use greed decoding as we did not see improvements with temperature sampling in our
early experiments. We use 90, 180 degree rotations, horizontal, vertical, and diagonal (transpose) flips as our invertible
transformations.
With that, the whole TTT and inference process takes approximately 12 hours for 100 randomly sampled validation tasks
when using an NVIDIA A100 GPU.

D. LM Data Generation
We described three approaches in Appendix B to use LM, we generated 6426 task generators by few-shot prompting GPT-4
and GPT-4o models (OpenAI, 2024; Hurst et al., 2024).

D.1. Getting Descriptions for Tasks
This procedure is shown in Figure 15. We initially described 10 training tasks with the hierarchical-style shown in Figure 11.
Then, for other training tasks tasks, we obtained less quality crowd-worker annotations from LARC (Acquaviva et al., 2022)
project. By using our high-quality seed annotations and their LARC version, we 10-shot prompt and LM to produce high
quality annotations for the other training tasks.

D.2. Few-shot Prompting Details
We use the following simple prompting template with k-shot prompting for all data generation procedures, where numbers
filled with examples sampled from seed set. In simple few-shot generation, we exclude examples. We use GPT-4 and
GPT-4o to generate the new scripts.

   You are a problem generator on 2D grids of colors. Here are some examples of such transformations, please follow

E. Augmented Inference Pipeline
E.1. Augmented Inference
Recent work has shown that scaling test-time compute can significantly improve the performance of LMs. One of the
most common techniques to do this is by sampling multiple responses, and then selecting the best response using a ranker.
However, while sampling is very effective in domains with multiple possible solutions (programs in code) or multiple
possible paths to the final answer (math), it can be detrimental when generating answers directly, as there is no way to
directly enforce diversity across samples while ensuring coherence within samples. As an alternative inference-time scaling,
we use an augmented inference strategy that generates multiple prediction candidates by using geometric transformations,

For a given task with training examples (xk , yk )k=1 and test input xtest , we use invertible geometric transformations to
produce equivalent transformed versions of the task, as shown in Figure 5. Let T be some set set of invertible geometric
transformations (e.g., rotations and reflections). For each transformation t ∈ T , we apply t to all training demonstrations
and the test input and run our model with these transformed inputs. We then apply the inverse transformation to obtain the
final prediction for that transformation.

                                       ỹ ∼ LM(t(dinput )) := [t(x1 ), t(y1 ), . . . , t(xtest )]                             (6)

                                      yt = t        (ỹ)                                                                      (7)

We further augment our predictions by permuting the order of training examples. For each transformation g, we sample
n = 2 different permutations of the demonstration sequence, resulting in n · |T | total predictions per task. This is to mitigate
any bias in the model’s processing of the demonstration sequence. (Bober-Irizar & Banerjee, 2024) also find transpose and
rotation is helpful to produce extra prediction candidates.

E.2. Ensembling Predictions (Voting Strategy)
                                                                                                           n·|T |
We employ a hierarchical voting strategy to determine the final prediction from the set of candidates {y}i=1 . This approach
involves two stages of voting to progressively narrow down the best candidates: first, by selecting the most frequent
predictions within each transformation, and then by conducting an overall vote across transformation-specific candidates to
identify the top-2 most frequent predictions. The details of each stage are as follows:

  1. Intra Transformation Voting: We group predictions by their corresponding transformation t and select the top-3 most
     frequent predictions within each group. If fewer than 3 unique predictions exist within a group, we supplement the
     candidates by computing additional predictions through:
        • Row-based majority: For each row in the predicted output grid, we take the most frequent row values across all
          predictions in the transformation group.
        • Column-based majority: Similarly, for each column in the predicted output grid, we take the most frequent
          column values across all predictions in the transformation group.

  2. Global Voting: Using the selected transformation-specific candidates obtained from (1), we conduct an overall vote to
     select the top-2 most frequent predictions for submission. In case of a tie, predictions with the identity transformation
     are given priority.

F. BIG-Bench Hard Details
F.1. Further Experimental Details
We write our own evaluation function for BIG-Bench Hard available in our codebase. We found that existing evaluation
frameworks did not properly measure zero-shot performance due to insufficient answer-extraction parsing and answer-format
prompting. We also wanted more control in splitting each individual task’s dataset into demonstration examples and
evaluation sets. For all results, we average results over different selections of the 10 few-shot examples with the following 5
random seeds: 42, 43, 44, 45, 46. The full TTT and inference process takes approximately 15 minutes on an NVIDIA A100
GPU.
The standard error of the mean for each method in Figure 8 over the 5 seeds is given in Table 7.
