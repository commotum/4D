### 6. Input and Representation Constraints
- Input modality: point clouds. Evidence: "Uni3DL operates directly on point clouds." (Abstract)
- Text modality also used. Evidence: "a Text Encoder for textual feature extraction; a Point Encoder dedicated to point feature learning;" (Section 3.1 Method overview)
- Colored point clouds and voxelization: "A colored input point cloud," and it "undergoes quantization into N0 voxels represented as V0" (Section 3.2 Point Cloud and Text Encoder)
- Variable point counts but fixed-length transformer inputs: "Point clouds in a batch usually have different numbers of points, leading to differing voxel quantities. Current transformer implementations generally require a fixed length of inputs in each batch entry." (Section 3.3 Query Transformer Module)
- Voxel sampling to enforce fixed length: "The sampled voxel features are then utilized across all cross-attention layers following [56]." (Section 3.3 Query Transformer Module)
- Fixed voxel size during pretraining: "During pretraining, the voxel size is set to 0.02m for 3D scans (e.g., ScanNet (v2)) and 0.01 for normalized 3D shapes (e.g., Cap3D Objaverse)" (Section 4.2 Implementation Details)
- Fixed number of latent queries: "In this work, we employ 150 latent queries and an additional latent query for scene-level tasks." (Section 4.2 Implementation Details)
- Fixed patch size: Not specified in the paper.
- Fixed number of tokens (text): Not specified in the paper.
- Fixed dimensionality (2D vs 3D): The model operates on 3D point clouds; "Uni3DL operates directly on point clouds." (Abstract)
- Padding/resizing requirements: Not specified beyond voxel sampling and fixed voxel size (see quotes above).

### 7. Context Window and Attention Structure
- Maximum sequence length: Not specified in the paper. (Only the number of latent queries is given: "we employ 150 latent queries and an additional latent query for scene-level tasks." Section 4.2)
- Fixed vs variable length: Inputs are variable length but sampled to a fixed length per batch. Evidence: "Point clouds in a batch usually have different numbers of points, leading to differing voxel quantities. Current transformer implementations generally require a fixed length of inputs in each batch entry." (Section 3.3 Query Transformer Module)
- Attention type: Cross-attention and self-attention. Evidence: "a Query Transformer Module with a sequence of cross-attention and self-attention layers" (Section 3.1 Method overview) and "We further enhance object and text queries through self-attention layers" (Section 3.3 Query Transformer Module)
- Masked attention: "Masked Attention. ... use masked attention instead of vanilla cross-attention where each query only attends to masked voxels predicted by the previous layer." (Section 3.3 Query Transformer Module)
- Causal masking for captioning: "During training, a causal masking strategy is adopted in all self-attention layers of the decoder network." (Section 3.4 Text Generation Head)
- Mechanisms to manage cost: Voxel sampling for fixed-length batching and masked attention (see quotes above).

### 8. Positional Encoding (Critical Section)
Not specified in the paper.

### 9. Positional Encoding as a Variable
Not specified in the paper.

### 10. Evidence of Constraint Masking
- Model size/capacity indicators (no parameter counts given): "In this work, we employ 150 latent queries and an additional latent query for scene-level tasks." and "we use 12 transformer layers for the language encoder. Our Query Transformer module consists of 15 (L = 15) transformer layers." (Section 4.2 Implementation Details)
- Dataset sizes: "ScanNet (v2) [20] captures RGB-D videos with 2.5 million views from more than 1,500 3D scans." and "ScanRefer [9] dataset contains 51,583 referring descriptions of 11,046 objects from 800 ScanNet scenes." (Section 4.1 Dataset); "Cap3D Objaverse [45] dataset, is derived from Objaverse, one of the largest 3D datasets with around 800K objects. It features 660K 3D-text pairs..." (Section 4.1 Dataset); "Text2Shape [12] contains 8,447 table instances and 6,591 chair instances..." (Section 4.1 Dataset)
- Performance gains attributed to pretraining (not scaling model size): "As evidenced in Table 4, the pretraining stage significantly enhances performance across all downstream tasks." (Section 4.7 Ablation Study)
- Explicit attribution to scaling model size or data as the primary driver: Not specified in the paper.

### 11. Architectural Workarounds
- Task router with multiple heads for task composition: "a Task Router, adaptable and comprising multiple functional heads, including a text generation head for generating text outputs, a class head for object classification, and a mask head for producing segmentation masks, a grounding head for text-to-object grounding, and a 3D-Text matching head for 3D-text cross modal matching." (Section 3.1 Method overview)
- Masked attention to restrict cross-attention: "use masked attention instead of vanilla cross-attention where each query only attends to masked voxels predicted by the previous layer." (Section 3.3 Query Transformer Module)
- Voxel sampling for fixed-length batching: "Current transformer implementations generally require a fixed length of inputs in each batch entry." and "The sampled voxel features are then utilized across all cross-attention layers" (Section 3.3 Query Transformer Module)
- Causal masking for autoregressive captioning: "During training, a causal masking strategy is adopted in all self-attention layers of the decoder network." (Section 3.4 Text Generation Head)
- Hierarchical point encoder: "Given an input point cloud P, our Uni3DL leverages a 3D U-Net EI to extract hierarchy voxel features V" (Section 3.1 Method overview)

### 12. Explicit Limitations and Non-Claims
- Limitation/future work: "While these projection-based methods are limited by their handling of geometric information, their integration with powerful 2D pretrained foundation models, such as CLIP, has yielded promising results." (Section D. Limitation and Future Work)
- Future work direction: "To leverage the benefits of both point-based and projection-based techniques, our future work will focus on a hybrid approach." and "This strategy aims to concurrently learn joint 2D and 3D features, integrating insights from 2D foundation models." (Section D. Limitation and Future Work)
- Explicit non-claims about open-world learning, unrestrained multi-task learning, or meta-learning: Not specified in the paper.

### 13. Constraint Profile (Synthesis)
- Domain scope: Multiple 3D domains (scans, objects, shapes) with language inputs; evidence in Sections 4.1 and B.1 and "a Text Encoder... a Point Encoder..." (Section 3.1).
- Task structure: Multi-task across segmentation, detection, grounding, captioning, retrieval, and classification (Abstract; Section 3.1).
- Representation rigidity: Point clouds with voxelization and fixed voxel sizes; fixed-length batching via voxel sampling; fixed number of latent queries (Sections 3.3 and 4.2).
- Model sharing vs specialization: Shared parameters with task-specific routing and heads; per-task finetuning for several tasks (Section 3.4; Appendix A.2).
- Positional encoding: Not specified in the paper.

### 14. Final Classification
Multi-task, multi-domain (constrained).
Justification: The paper evaluates multiple tasks such as "semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, visual grounding, 3D captioning, and text-3D cross-modal retrieval" (Abstract), and uses multiple datasets spanning scans and shapes (Section 4.1 Dataset; Appendix B.1). The scope remains constrained to 3D point clouds and language with a unified architecture and task router, rather than open-world or unrestrained multi-domain learning (Sections 3.1 and 3.4).
