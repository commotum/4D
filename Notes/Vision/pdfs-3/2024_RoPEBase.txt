                                                Position embedding is a core component of current Large Language Models
                                                (LLMs). Rotary position embedding (RoPE), a technique that encodes
                                                the position information with a rotation matrix, has been the de facto
                                                choice for position embedding in many LLMs, such as the Llama series.
                                                RoPE has been further utilized to extend long context capability, which
                                                is roughly based on adjusting the base parameter of RoPE to mitigate out-
                                                of-distribution (OOD) problems in position embedding. However, in this
                                                paper, we find that LLMs may obtain a superficial long-context ability
                                                based on the OOD theory. We revisit the role of RoPE in LLMs and propose
                                                a novel property of long-term decay, we derive that the base of RoPE bounds
                                                context length: there is an absolute lower bound for the base value to obtain
                                                certain context length capability. Our work reveals the relationship between
                                                context length and RoPE base both theoretically and empirically, which
                                                may shed light on future long context training.

1   Introduction

In the past few years, large language models have demonstrated surprising capabilities and
undergone rapid development. By now, LLMs have been widely applied across various
domains, including chatbots, intelligent agents, and code assistants (Achiam et al., 2023;
Jiang et al., 2023b). The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), based on the attention mechanism,
has been the most popular backbone of LLMs due to its good performance and scaling
properties (Tay et al., 2022). One of the key component modules in the Transformer is
position embedding, which is introduced to embed positional information that is vital for
processing sequential data. Rotary position embedding (RoPE), which encodes relative
distance information in the form of absolute position embedding (Su et al., 2024), has been a
popular choice and applied in many LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023a; Yang et al., 2023; Bai et al.,
2023).
RoPE introduces no training parameters and shows improvement in language modeling
and many other tasks (Su et al., 2024; Heo et al., 2024). One reason that RoPE is widely used
is its ability for context length extrapolation (Peng et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023), which
extends the context length of a trained LLM without expensive retraining. In practice, many
works (Touvron et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2024a; Young et al., 2024) have successfully extended
the window length by simply increasing base value, the only one hyper-parameter in RoPE,
and fine-tuning on long texts.
The reasons behind the success of these long context extensions are often explained as
avoiding out-of-distribution (OOD) rotation angles (Liu et al., 2024b; Han et al., 2023) in
RoPE, meaning the extended context length (OOD) can be mapped to the in-distribution
context length that has been properly trained. Based on the OOD theory, a recent study (Liu
et al., 2024b) finds that a smaller base can mitigate OOD and is beneficial for the model’s
ability to process long contexts, which inspires us to further study the relationship between
the base of RoPE and the length of context the model can process.
In this paper, we find that the model may show superficial long context capability with
an inappropriate RoPE base value, in which case the model can only preserve low per-
plexity but loses the ability to retrieve long context information. We also show that the
out-of-distribution (OOD) theory in position embedding, which motivates most length
extrapolation works (Peng et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b), is insufficient
to fully reflect the model’s ability to process long contexts. Therefore, we revisit the role
of RoPE in LLMs and derive a novel property of long-term decay in RoPE: the ability to
attend more attention to similar tokens than random tokens decays as the relative distance
increases. While previous long context works often focus on the relative scale of the RoPE
base, based on our theory, we derive an absolute lower bound for the base value of RoPE
to obtain a certain context length ability, as shown in Figure 1. To verify our theory, we
conducted thorough experiments on various LLMs such as Llama2-7B (Touvron et al.,
2023b), Baichuan2-7B (Yang et al., 2023) and a 2-billion model we trained from scratch,
demonstrating that this lower bound holds not only in the fine-tuning stage but also in the
pre-training stage.
We summarize the contributions of the paper as follows:

      • Theoretical perspective: we derive a novel property of long-term decay in RoPE,
        indicating the model’s ability to attend more to similar tokens than random tokens,
        which is a new perspective to study the long context capability of the LLMs.

      • Lower Bound of RoPE’s Base: to achieve the expected context length capability, we
        derive an absolute lower bound for RoPE’s base according to our theory. In short,
        the base of RoPE bounds context length.

      • Superficial Capability: we reveal that if the RoPE’s base is smaller than a lower
        bound, the model may obtain superficial long context capability, which can preserve
        low perplexity but lose the ability to retrieve information from long context.

2     Background

In this section, we first introduce the Transformer and RoPE, which are most commonly
used in current LLMs. Then we discuss long context methods based on the OOD of rotation
angle theory.

2.1   Attention and RoPE

The LLMs in current are primarily based on the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). The core
component of it is the calculation of the attention mechanism. The naive attention can be
written as:
                                                   Aij = qiT k j                                                              (1)
                                                                                 √
                                        ATTN( X ) = softmax( A/ d) v,                                                         (2)

where A ∈ R L× L q, k, v ∈ Rd . Position embedding is introduced to make use of the order of
the sequence in attention.
RoPE (Su et al., 2024) implements relative position embedding through absolute position
embedding, which applies rotation matrix into the calculation of the attention score in Eq. 1,
which can be written as:
                             Aij = ( Ri,θ qi ) T ( R j,θ k i ) = qiT R j−i,θ k j = qiT Rm,θ k j ,                             (3)

where m = j − i is the relative distance of i and j, Rm,θ is a rotation matrix denoted as:
                  cos(mθ0 )     −sin(mθ0 )       0           0        ···           0                0          

                        0           0        cos(mθ1 )   −sin(mθ1 )   ···           0                0          
                         0           0        sin(mθ1 )   cos(mθ1 )    ···           0                0
                                                                                                                              (4)

                         .           .            .           .            ..         .               .
                         .           .            .           .                       .               .
                                                                                                                
                         0           0            0           0        ···      cos(mθd/2−1 )   −sin(mθd/2−1 )
                         0           0            0           0        ···      sin(mθd/2−1 )   cos(mθd/2−1 )


Generally, the selection of rotation angles satisfies θi = base−2i/d , the typical base value for
current LLMs is 10,000, and the base of RoPE in LLMs is shown in Table 1.

2.2   OOD theory of relative rotation angle

Based on RoPE, researchers have proposed various methods to extend the long context
ability of LLMs, among which representatives are PI (Chen et al., 2023) and NTK-series
(NTK-aware (bloc97, 2023), YaRN (Peng et al., 2023b), and Dynamical-NTK (emozilla, 2023)).
Those methods depend on the relative scale s = Tnew /Torigin , where Torigin is the training
length of the original pre-trained model and Tnew is the training length in long-context
fine-tuning.

PI PI directly interpolates the position embedding, and the calculation of Aij becomes:

                          Aij = ( Ri/s qi ) T ( R j/s k i ) = qiT R( j−i)/s k j = qiT Rm/s k j ,                              (5)

In other words, the position embedding of the token at position i in pre-training becomes
i/s in fine-tuning, ensuring the position embedding range of the longer context remains the
same as before.

Figure 2: An illustration of OOD in RoPE when we extend context length from 4k to 32k, and
two solutions to avoid the OOD. We show the last dimension as it is the lowest frequency
part of RoPE, which suffers OOD mostly in extrapolation. (a) For a 4k context-length model
with base value as 1e4, when we extend the context length to 32k without changing the
base value, the context length from 4k to 32k is OOD for RoPE (red area in the figure).
(b) OOD can be avoided with a small base value like 500 (Liu et al., 2024b), since the full

et al., 2023b).The blue line denotes the pre-training stage (base=1e4) and the red dashed line
                                                                  d
denotes the fine-tuning stage (base=b · s d−2 ), we can observe that the RoPE’s rotation angle
of extended positions is in-distribution.


NTK-series The idea is that neural networks are difficult to learn high-frequency features,
and direct interpolation can affect the high-frequency parts. Therefore, the NTK-aware
method achieves high-frequency extrapolation and low-frequency interpolation by modify-
ing the base value of RoPE. Specifically, it modifies the base b of the RoPE to:
                                                                                d
                                                               bnew = b s d−2 .                                                                    (6)

                                                                                              − d −2                   d −2
The derivation of this expression is derived from Tnew bnewd = Torigin b− d to ensure that
the lowest frequency part being interpolated.
A recent study (Liu et al., 2024b) proposes to set a much smaller base (e.g. 500), in which
                               2i
case θi = base− d is small enough and typical training length (say 4,096) fully covers the
period of cos(t − s)θi , so the model can obtain longer context capabilities.
One perspective to explain current extrapolation methods is the OOD of rotation angle (Liu
et al., 2024b; Han et al., 2023). If all possible values of cos(t − s)θi have been fitted during
the pre-training stage, OOD would be avoided when processing longer context. Figure 2
demonstrates how these methods avoid OOD of RoPE.


3          Motivation

NTK-based methods are widely adopted in long-context extension (Touvron et al., 2023a;
Liu et al., 2024a; Young et al., 2024). To obtain better long-context capability, however,
practitioners often adopt a much larger base than the original NTK-aware method suggested.
This leads to speculation that there is another bound of RoPE’s base determined by context
length.
On the other hand, a recent work (Liu et al., 2024b) proposes to set a much smaller base for
RoPE to extend the context length. However, we find it may be a superficial long-context
capability as shown in Figure 3. This method can obtain a low perplexity even at 128k
context length, which can be explained by the OOD theory as explained above, but the
model could not retrieve related information for context length as short as 1k, even much
shorter than the model’s pre-trained length. Our findings support previous research (Hu

deep into this phenomenon, we do the theoretical exploration in the next section.

4                  Theory Perspective
For attention mechanism in language modeling, we have the following desiderata:

Desiderata 1 The closer token gets more attention: the current token tends to pay more attention
to the token that has a smaller relative distance.

Desiderata 2 The similar token gets more attention: the token tends to pay more attention to
the token whose key value is more similar to the query value of the current token.

Then we examine the desiderata when we apply RoPE to the attention mechanism in LLMs.

4.1                  Long-term Decay of Upper Bound of Attention Score

For Desiderata 1, the property of RoPE makes the model attend more to closer tokens. This
kind of long-term decay has been thoroughly discussed in previous work (Su et al., 2024;
Sun et al., 2022). It comes from the upper bound of attention score calculation, which can be
written as:
                                                                                                                                                   d/2
                                               | Aij | = |qiT Rm k j | ≤ max(|hl − hl +1 |) ∑ |Sn |
                                                                                                l                                              n =1
                                                                                                                                                   d/2 n−1          √
                                                                                          = max(|hl − hl +1 |) ∑ | ∑ e( j−i)θl                                          −1
                                                                                                                                                                              |,                    (7)
                                                                                                l                                              n =1 l =0

where hl = qiT [2l : l2 + 1]k j [2l : 2l + 1]. Equation 7 indicates that the upper bound of the
attention score | Aij | decays as the relative distance increases. Figure 4 shows the long-term
decay curve of this upper bound, which is in accordance with previous findings (Su et al.,
2024; Sun et al., 2022).

4.2                  Long-term Decay of the Ability to Attend More to Similar Tokens than Random
                     Tokens

In addition to the attention score’s upper bound, we also find there exists another long-term
decay property in RoPE: the ability to attend more to similar tokens than random tokens
decays as the relative distance increases. We define the ability to attend more to similar
tokens than random tokens as:

where q ∈ Rd is the query vector for the current token, k∗ = q + ϵ is the key value of a
similar token, where ϵ is a small random variable, k ∈ Rd is the key vector of a random
token, Rm,θ is the rotation matrix in RoPE. The first term in Eq. 8 is the attention score of q
and a similar token k∗ , the second term in Eq. 8 is the attention score of q and random token
k. Then we derive the following theorem:

Theorem 1 Assuming that the components of query q ∈ Rd and key k ∈ Rd are independent and
identically distributed, their standard deviations are denoted as σ ∈ R. The key k∗ = q + ϵ is a
token similar to the query, where ϵ is a random variable with a mean of 0. Then we have:
                                                                             d/2−1

                                                      −1
The proof is shown in Appendix A. We denote ∑id/2  =0    cos(mθi ) as Bm,θ , and according to
Theorem 1, Bm,θ measures the ability to give more attention to similar tokens than random
tokens, which decreases as the relative distance m increases, as shown in Figure 5. For a
very small base value, we can observe that the Bm,θ is even below zero at a certain distance,
meaning the random tokens have larger attention scores than the similar tokens, which may
be problematic for long context modeling.

4.3   Base of RoPE Bounds the Context Length

To satisfy the Desiderata 2, we will get Eq,k∗ q T Rm,θ k∗ ≥ Eq,k q T Rm,θ k . According to
                                                                         

Theorem 1, Bm,θ needs to be larger than zero. Given the θ in RoPE, the context length Lθ
that can be truly obtained satisfies:
                                                                   Lθ = sup{ L| Bm,θ ≥ 0, ∀m ∈ [0, 1, ..., L]}                                                                 (10)
In other word, if we follow the setting that θi = base−2i/d , in order to get the expected
context length L, there is a lower bound of the base value base L :
                                                              base L = inf{base| Bm,θ ≥ 0, ∀m ∈ [0, 1, ..., L]}                                                                (11)
In summary, the RoPE’s base determines the upper bound of context length the model
can truly obtain. Although there exists the absolute lower bound, Eq. 9 and Eq. 11 are
hard to get the closed-form solution since Bm,θ is a summation of many cosine functions.
Therefore, in this paper, we get the numerical solution. Table 2 shows this lower bound for
context length ranging from 1,000 to one million. In Figure 1, we plot the context length
and corresponding lower bound, we can observe that as the context length increases, the
required base also increases.
Note: this boundary is not very strict because the stacking of layers in LLMs allows the model to
extract information beyond the single layers’ range, which may increase the context length in Eq. 10
and decrease the base in Eq. 11. Notwithstanding, in Section 5 we find that the derived bound
approximates the real context length in practice.
Long-term decay from different perspectives. The long-term decay in section 4.1 and

attention score as the relative distance increases. This ensures that current tokens tend to pay
more attention to the tokens closer to them. The latter indicates that with the introduction of
the rotation matrix in attention, the ability to discriminate the relevant tokens from irrelevant
tokens decreases as the relative distance increases. Therefore, a large Bm,θ , corresponding to
a large base value, is important to keep the model’s discrimination ability in long context
modeling.

5     Experiment

In this section, we conduct thorough experiments. The empirical result can be summarized
in Table 3, the details are in the following sections.

                Table 3: In Section 5, we aim to answer the following questions.

                   Questions                                                   Answers
    Q: Does RoPE’s base bounds the context        Yes. When the base is small, it is difficult to get extrapolation
    length during the fine-tuning stage?          for specific context length.
                                                  Yes. Our proposed lower bound for RoPE’s base also applies
                                                  to pre-training. If we train a model from scratch with a small

                                                  base but the context length is large (larger than the bounded
    length during the pre-training stage?
                                                  length), the resulting model has very limited the context length
                                                  capabilities, meaning some of context in pre-training is wasted.
                                                  The model will get the superficial long context capability.
    Q: What happened when base is set
                                                  The model can keep perplexity low, but can’t retrieve useful

                                                  information from long context.


5.1    Experiments Setup

For fine-tuning, we utilized Llama2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023a) and Baichuan2-7B (Yang et al.,
2023), both of which are popular open-source models employing RoPE with a base of 1e4.
We utilized a fixed learning rate of 2e-5 and a global batch size of 128 and fine-tuning for
1000 steps. For pre-training, we trained a Llama-like 2B model from scratch for a total of
1 trillion tokens. We set the learning rate to 1e-4 and adopted a cosine decay schedule,
with models trained on a total of 1T tokens. The dataset we used is a subset of RedPajama
(Computer, 2023). More details of the experimental setup are provided in Appendix B.
Our evaluation focused on two aspects: (1) Perplexity: we use PG19 dataset (Rae et al., 2019)
which are often used in long context evaluation; (2) Retrieval: in addition to perplexity,
we also adopt retrieval since it represents the real long-context understanding ability of
LLMs. We choose a) Long-eval benchmark from (Li* et al., 2023) and b) needle in a haystack
(NIH) (G, 2023). The Long-eval benchmark generates numerous random similar sentences
and asks the model to answer questions based on a specific sentence within the context,
while the NIH requires the model to retrieve information from various positions in the long
context.

5.2    Base of RoPE bounds context length in fine-tuning stages

According to Eq. 11, there is a lower bound of RoPE’s base determined by expected context
length. We fine-tune Llama2-7b-Base on 32k context with varying bases. As depicted in
Figure 6, although the difference in perplexity between different bases is negligible, the
accuracy of Long-eval varies significantly. In Figure 6b, the dotted line denotes the lower
bound derived from Eq. 11, below which the Long-eval accuracy declines significantly.

significantly. The dotted line denotes the lower bound derived from Eq. 11.

Figure 7: The first row: the results of a 2B model training from scratch with base=1e2. The
second row: The results of fine-tuning the 2B model with base=1e4. The third row: The
results of fine-tuning the 2B model with base=1e6.


Additional results are provided in Appendix C. Notably, this empirically observed lower
bound closely aligns with our theoretical derivation. On the other hand, we can see that
base = 2e5 achieves the best perplexity, but the accuracy of Long-eval is very low, which
indicates the limitations of perplexity in evaluating long context capabilities.

5.3                The Base of RoPE bounds context length in pre-training stages

According to and Theorem 1 and Eq. 11, this constraints could also apply to pre-training
stage. To validate this, we trained a 2B model from scratch with RoPE base=100. The results,
depicted in the first row of Figure 7, indicate that even though the model was trained with a


                                                                                                          8
context length of 4,096 tokens, it was capable of retrieving information from only the most
recent approximately 500 tokens. This demonstrates that the base parameter bounds the
context length during the pre-training stage as well. We define the context length from
which the model can effectively retrieve information as the effective context length.
And according to our theory, the effective context length can be extended as the RoPE’s
base increases. To validate this, we further fine-tune this 2B model on 32k context length,
with RoPE’s base set to 1e4, as shown in the second row of Figure 7. While the effective
context length increased, it remains significantly below 32k since the effective context length
bounded by base=1e4 is much smaller than 32k. Further, when we increase the base to 1e6
and fine-tune the base 2B model on 32K (the third row in Figure 7), the model could obtain
a larger context length than base=1e4, which is in accodance with our theory.
To further remove the influence of model size, we also fine-tuned a larger 7B model on a
32k context length with a RoPE base set to 1e4 and observed an effective context length
nearly identical to that of the 2B model with the same RoPE base (see Appendix D). This is
empirical proof that the effective context length is determined by RoPE’s base.

5.4   Interpretation for the superficial long context capability for small base

Based on our theory and empirical observations, it is easy to explain what happens in Figure
3.
Better Extrapolation (Perplexity)? Due to the small base, Bm,θ can be smaller than zero as m
increases, which is shown in Figure 5. The model can’t attend more to similar tokens than
random tokens with a large relative distance, so the model tends to focus more on nearby
tokens, this will lead to a smaller empirical receptive field, even smaller than the training
length. In this case, the model has a strong ability to maintain perplexity stability (Chi et al.,
2023).
Worse Ability (Long-eval and NIH)! According to our previous analysis, RoPE’s base
bounds the context length, and the context length bounded by 500 is much lower than that
bound by 10,000. Therefore, when the base is set to 500, the effective context length drops
sharply, even after training on 32k context length.

5.5   OOD theory is insufficient to reveal long context capability

Table 4: The comparison of "Method 1" and "Method 2". These methods are designed
carefully. They both are no OOD, but they are very different under our theory.

                                    Long-eval         numbers of m whose Bm,θ ≥ 0
              Method      OOD
                                    15k 30k           15k            30k
             Method 1               0.33   0.27       0               0
             Method 2               0.40   0.00       97            2554

Section 3 mentions that methods based on the OOD theory of rotation angles may not
fully reflect the long context capability. In this section, we conduct further experiments to
substantiate and explain this observation. We present two methods to extend the context
length of Llama2 from 4k to 32k. Both of them are devoid of OOD angles. These methods
are delineated mathematically as follows:

      • Method 1: θi = (5e6)−2i/d ,
                         (1e4)−2i/128 /8,
                       (
                                                           i ≥ 44
      • Method 2: θi =
                         (1e4 ∗ 8128/88 )−2i/128 ,      i < 44.

We can see from Table 4 that these two methods exhibit significantly different long context
capabilities. Under the perspective of OOD rotation angle, both methods avoid OOD
rotation angle, suggesting effective extrapolation. However, despite being trained on a


                                                  9
context length of 32k, "method 2" struggles in completing the retrieval task at a context
length of 32k. This phenomenon is beyond the scope which the OOD theory can explain.
Under our perspective, "method 2" is severely violating Bm,θ ≥ 0 when m ∈ [15k, 30k],
thereby impeding its ability to achieve long-context discrimination. We speculate that the
model may achieve better extrapolation in the fine-tuning stage if the base is sufficiently
large to surpass a lower bound and avoid OOD of rotation angles.

6   Related Work
Position embedding. Since its introduction, Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) has
achieved remarkable results in the field of natural language processing. To make full
use of the order of sequence, researchers have introduced position embedding. The ear-
liest position embedding was based on sinusoidal functions (Vaswani et al., 2017) for
absolute positions, learnable absolute position embedding (Devlin et al., 2018) and many
variants (Kiyono et al., 2021; Li et al., 2019) were proposed. Nevertheless, absolute position
embedding has difficulties in extending directly to texts longer than the training length.
Subsequently, researchers proposed relative position embedding methods (Shaw et al., 2018;
Ke et al., 2020). With the development of large language models, rotary position embedding
and its variants (Su et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2022) has become widely used, such as Llama2
(Touvron et al., 2023a), Baichuan2 (Yang et al., 2023), Mistral-7B-(Jiang et al., 2023a). A recent
study reveals that no position embedding is also potential (Kazemnejad et al., 2024).

Long context learning. Implementing models with longer or even infinitely long contexts
has always been an important goal in the field of natural language processing. Due to the
squared complexity of the transformer model over time, a significant portion of the work
focuses on improving the model structure (Gu & Dao, 2023;?; Peng et al., 2023a; Qin et al.,
2024). However, most of the work is still based on the transformer architecture. The other
part of the work is aimed at reducing the computational complexity of attention itself, such
as sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020) and group query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). In
addition, there are also some optimizations in engineering efficiency, such as flash attention
(Dao et al., 2022) and ring attention (Liu et al., 2023). In the model inference stage, to save
time and space, there are also some methods for accelerating long context, such as KV
cache compression (Hooper et al., 2024), etc. And the position embedding is important in
extrapolation. In the process of fine-tuning, methods such as PI (Chen et al., 2023), NTK, and
YARN (Peng et al., 2023b) are used to change the original position embedding information.
FoT (Tworkowski et al., 2024) assigns the position information of the tokens outside the
local context as the first token in the local context.

7   Limitation
In this work, we investigate the relationship between the base of RoPE and context length.
Although we have derived that there exists a lower bound for the base of RoPE determined
by context length, the existence of the upper bound for RoPE’s base remains an open
question that warrants further exploration. In addition, because of the lack of effective
benchmarks for assessing long-context capabilities, the scope of long-context capabilities
discussed in this paper may be limited.

8   Conclusion
Our work presents a comprehensive study on the role of RoPE in LLMs for effectively
modeling long context. Our main contribution lies in uncovering a novel property of RoPE
through theoretical analysis, demonstrating that as the relative distance between tokens
increases, the model’s ability to attend more to similar tokens decreases. According to our
theory, we derive a lower bound for RoPE’s base in accommodating to expected context
lengths. Our experimental results validate that the base of RoPE bounds context length for
not only fine-tuning but also the pre-training stage. Our theory offers a new perspective on


                                               10
understanding the functionality of RoPE in long-context modeling. By shedding light on
the relationship between context length and position embedding, we hope our work could
provide insights for enhancing the long context capability of LLMs.

A       The proof of Theorem 1.

Assuming that the components of query q ∈ Rd and key k ∈ Rd are independent, their
standard deviations are denoted as σ ∈ Rd and the means are donated as µ ∈ Rd . The key
k∗ similar to q is q + ϵ, where ϵ is a random variable with a mean of 0. Then, we have:


    Eq,k∗ q T Rm k∗ − Eq,k q T Rm k
=Eq q T Rm q + Eq,ϵ q T Rm ϵ − Eq,k q T Rm k
        d/2−1
=Eq         ∑ (q22i cos(mθi ) − q2i q2i+1 sin(mθi ) + q2i+1 q2i sin(mθi ) + q22i+1 cos(mθi )) + Eq qT Rm Eϵ ϵ
         i =0
                d/2−1
    − Eq,k       ∑ (q2i k2i cos(mθi ) − q2i k2i+1 sin(mθi ) + q2i+1 k2i sin(mθi ) + q2i+1 k2i+1 cos(mθi ))
                 i =0
    d/2−1
=     ∑ E(q22i ) cos(mθi ) − µ2i µ2i+1 sin(mθi ) + µ2i µ2i+1 sin(mθi ) + E(q22i+1 ) cos(mθi )) + µRm 0
     i =0
        d/2−1
    −    ∑ (µ22i cos(mθi ) − µ2i µ2i+1 sin(mθi ) + µi µ2i+1 sin(mθi ) + µ22i+1 cos(mθi ))
         i =0
    d/2−1
=     ∑ (E(q22i + q22i+1 ) − µ22i − µ22i+1 ) cos(mθi )
     i =0
    d/2−1
=     ∑ (σi2 + σi2+1 ) cos(mθi )                                                                      (12)
     i =0

Then we can get:


                         d/2−1
                          ∑ (σ2i2 + σ2i2 +1 ) cos(mθi ) = Eq,k∗ qT Rm k∗ − Eq,k qT Rm k               (13)
                          i =0

And when all σ are equal, we can get:
                            d/2−1
                                                  1
                                 ∑ cos(mθi ) = 2σ2 (Eq,k∗ qT Rm k∗ − Eq,k qT Rm k)                    (14)
                                 i =0


B       The detail setting of experiment.
For training, we mainly conducted experiments on Llama2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023a) and
Baichuan2-7B (Yang et al., 2023). In addition, we also trained a 2B model from scratch, whose
structure is the same with Baichuan2-7B-Base but with a smaller hidden size = 2048. Both
training and testing are accelerated by FlashAttention-2 (Dao et al., 2022) and Megatron-LM
(Shoeybi et al., 2020). The dataset of both fine-tuning and training from scratch is a subset of
RedPajama (Computer, 2023). The hyper parameters of training are list in Appendix 5. All
experiments are conducted on a cluster of 16 machines with 128 NVIDIA A100 80G.
For evaluation, we test the long context capabilities comprehensively, the benchmarks are
listed below: perplexity on PG19 (Rae et al., 2019) test split. We evaluate the perplexity of
each sample and get the mean value across samples.
Long-eval (Li* et al., 2023). This test generates massive random similar sentences and asks
the model to answer questions according to a specific sentence in the context. Because the
long context consists of many similar patterns, it’s more difficult to get the right answer.
We find this test is harder than other long context evaluations such as Perplexity, Passkey

                 Question: Below is a record of lines I want you to remember. Each line begins with 'line <line
                 index>' and contains a '<REGISTER_CONTENT>' at the end of the line as a numerical value. For
                 each line index, memorize its corresponding <REGISTER_CONTENT>. At the end of the record, I
                 will ask you to retrieve the corresponding <REGISTER_CONTENT> of a certain line index. Now the
                 record start:
                 …
                 line swift-baby: REGISTER_CONTENT is <12821>
                 line dangerous-breast: REGISTER_CONTENT is <28051>
                 line bad-sculptural: REGISTER_CONTENT is <32916>
                 line flashy-college: REGISTER_CONTENT is <34027>
                 line voiceless-brochure: REGISTER_CONTENT is <8964>
                 line fast-peony: REGISTER_CONTENT is <5218>
                 …
                 Now the record is over. Tell me what is the <REGISTER_CONTENT> in line dangerous-breast? I
                 need the number. Answer:

Retrieval (Mohtashami & Jaggi, 2024), Needle in Haystack (G, 2023). A test sample is list in
Figure 8
needle in haystack(NIH) (G, 2023). NIH tests the long context capability not only under
different context lengths but also at different positions where the correct answer is located
in the context, which provides a more detailed view of the long context capability.
