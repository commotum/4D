Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 1
- Task 1: Formal language recognition/decision over strings; the paper proves that every language decidable by an average-hard attention transformer is in uniform TC0 and frames inputs as strings over an alphabet. (p.7)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1
- The paper studies a single model class (average-hard attention transformers) and provides a uniform TC0 simulation result without introducing separate task-specific variants or heads, so one model instance covers the single task. (p.1; p.7)

$$
\boxed{
\frac{1\ \text{task}}{1\ \text{model}} = 1
}
