Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 23
- Tasks 1-20: bAbI question-answering includes 20 task types. (p.4)
- Task 21: Pretty-CLEVR relational QA (object/jump questions). (p.5)
- Task 22: Sudoku solving. (p.6)
- Task 23: Age arithmetic (infer age from relations). (p.7)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 4
- One model jointly trained on all 20 bAbI tasks. (p.4)
- One model trained for Pretty-CLEVR. (p.5)
- One model trained for Sudoku. (p.6)
- One model trained for age arithmetic. (p.7)

$$
\boxed{
\frac{23\ \text{tasks}}{4\ \text{models}} = 5.75
}
