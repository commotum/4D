Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 6
- Delayed motion comparison (Pasternak data set): "Monkeys compared two motion stimuli separated by a brief delay." (2014_ITC.pdf)
- Motion-delayed match-to-category (Freedman data set): "Monkeys performed a motion-delayed match-to-category task." (2014_ITC.pdf)
- Competitive decision-making (matching pennies) (Lee data set): "Monkeys performed a competitive decision-making task called matching pennies." (2014_ITC.pdf)
- Value-based choice (Wallis data set): "Monkeys performed tasks involving value-based choice." (2014_ITC.pdf)
- Value-based choice (Padoa-Schioppa data set): "Monkeys performed tasks involving value-based choice." (2014_ITC.pdf)
- Vibrotactile delayed discrimination (Romo data set): "Two monkeys performed a vibrotactile delayed discrimination task." (2014_ITC.pdf)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 0
- Evidence the paper is analysis-only (no model training is described): "We used single-neuron spike train data, recorded in macaque monkeys, from the foreperiod of various cognitive tasks." and "Analysis. Our primary analysis was the temporal autocorrelation of spike counts." (2014_ITC.pdf)
