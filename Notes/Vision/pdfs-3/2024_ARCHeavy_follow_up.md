Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 2
- Task 1: ARC few-shot grid-to-grid transformation (public validation split and private test set). (2024_ARCHeavy.txt, Section 4; 2024_ARCHeavy.txt, Section 5)
- Task 2: ConceptARC (ARC-style concept-group tasks). (2024_ARCHeavy.txt, Section 6)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1
- ConceptARC is evaluated using the same models trained on ARC-Potpourri, so no task-specific model or head is required to cover ConceptARC in addition to ARC. (2024_ARCHeavy.txt, Section 6)
