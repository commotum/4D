1. Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 4 (Sudoku-Extreme, Maze-Hard, ARC-AGI-1, ARC-AGI-2). [2025_TRM.pdf:455-458]
2. Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 4 (the paper evaluates distinct datasets and specifies dataset-specific training for Sudoku-Extreme/Maze-Hard vs. ARC-AGI, with no single jointly trained multi-task model described; thus one trained instance per task is required). [2025_TRM.pdf:455-458; 2025_TRM.pdf:673-676]
3. Task-Model Ratio:
$$
\boxed{
\frac{4\ \text{tasks}}{4\ \text{models}} = 1
}
$$
