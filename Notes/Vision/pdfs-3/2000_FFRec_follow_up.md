Distinct tasks evaluated: 2.
- Detection of PRRSV RNA in serum samples and blood impregnated filter disks from experimentally inoculated pigs (Abstract: "We describe the detection of PRRSV RNA in serum samples and in blood impregnated filter disks (FDs) ... using a closed-tube, fluorimeter-based PCR assay.", 2000_FFRec.pdf).
- Differentiation of American vs European PRRSV strains (Abstract: "We also report a rapid fluorimeter based PCR method for differentiating American and European strains of PRRSV.", 2000_FFRec.pdf).

Trained model instances required: 2.
- The paper describes two task-specific PCR methods: one assay for detection and a separate rapid fluorimeter-based PCR method for strain differentiation, with no indication of a single unified model handling both tasks (same Abstract statements above, 2000_FFRec.pdf).
