1. Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 0. The paper only introduces geotokens and a spherical-coordinate RoPE-style position encoding mechanism, without describing any evaluation tasks or datasets. Evidence: "In this paper, we introduce the notion of \"geotokens\"... we formulate a position encoding mechanism based on RoPE architecture which is adjusted for spherical coordinates." (Abstract, p.1) and "we have presented a novel concept for the transformer architecture, integrating \"geotokens\"... we employed and extended the Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) mechanism to accommodate spherical coordinates" (Conclusion, p.4).

2. Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 0. Since no tasks are evaluated, there are no trained model instances required for task coverage. Evidence: the paper is framed as proposing the geotoken concept and spherical RoPE mechanism (Abstract, p.1; Conclusion, p.4).

3. Task-Model Ratio:

$$
\boxed{
\frac{0\ \text{tasks}}{0\ \text{models}} = \text{N/A}
}
$$
