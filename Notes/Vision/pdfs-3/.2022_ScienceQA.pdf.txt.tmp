Abstract
When answering a question, humans utilize the information available across different modalities to synthesize a consistent and complete chain of thought (CoT). This
process is normally a black box in the case of deep learning models like large-scale
language models. Recently, science question benchmarks have been used to diagnose the multi-hop reasoning ability and interpretability of an AI system. However,
existing datasets fail to provide annotations for the answers, or are restricted to
the textual-only modality, small scales, and limited domain diversity. To this end,
we present Science Question Answering (S CIENCE QA), a new benchmark that
consists of ∼21k multimodal multiple choice questions with diverse science topics
and annotations of their answers with corresponding lectures and explanations. We
further design language models to learn to generate lectures and explanations as the
chain of thought (CoT) to mimic the multi-hop reasoning process when answering
S CIENCE QA questions. S CIENCE QA demonstrates the utility of CoT in language
models, as CoT improves the question answering performance by 1.20% in fewshot GPT-3 and 3.99% in fine-tuned UnifiedQA. We also explore the upper bound
for models to leverage explanations by feeding those in the input; we observe that
it improves the few-shot performance of GPT-3 by 18.96%. Our analysis further
shows that language models, similar to humans, benefit from explanations to learn
from fewer data and achieve the same performance with just 40% of the data.1

Introduction

A long-standing goal of AI systems is to act reliably and learn complex tasks efficiently like human
beings. In the process of reliable decision making, humans follow an explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning process that is typically expressed as an explanation. However, machine learning models
are trained mostly using a large number of input-output examples to perform a specific task. These
black-box models only generate the final decision without reliably revealing the underlying reasoning
process. Not surprisingly, it is unclear if they understand the task and can generalize even though
they perform well on the benchmark. On the other hand, humans are able to learn from instructions
or explanations from past experience and generalize them to novel and unseen problems. This helps
them learn more quickly with fewer data. In this work, we explore if machines can be endowed with
such reasoning abilities in the context of science-based question answering.
Recently, science problem solving benchmarks [18] have been used to diagnose the multi-hop
reasoning ability and interpretability of AI systems. To answer science questions, a model needs to

Figure 1: We construct the S CIENCE QA dataset where a data example consists of multimodal
question answering information and the grounded lecture and explanation. We study if QA models
can generate a reasonable explanation to reveal the chain-of-thought reasoning.

not only understand multimodal contents but also extract external knowledge to arrive at the correct
answer. Since these tasks require domain-specific knowledge and explicit multi-hop reasoning, a
model would be not interpretable if it fails to provide explanations to reveal the reasoning process.
However, current science question datasets [18, 17, 52] mostly lack annotated explanations for the
answers. To address this issue, other science datasets annotate the explanations, but they are restricted
to the textual only modality and limited to small data scales [13, 7, 37] or a small set of topics [20, 14].
Therefore, we collect Science Question Answering (S CIENCE QA), a large-scale multi-choice dataset
that contains multimodal science questions with explanations and features rich domain diversity.
S CIENCE QA is collected from elementary and high school science curricula, and contains 21,208
examples along with lectures and explanations. Different from existing datasets [17, 18, 52], S CI ENCE QA has richer domain diversity from three different subjects: natural science, social science,
and language science. A typical example consists of a question, multiple choices, multimodal contexts, a correct answer, as well as a lecture and an explanation. The lecture and explanation provide
general external knowledge and specific reasons, respectively, for arriving at the correct answer.
Consider the thoughts one person might have when answering the question in Figure 1. One first
recalls the knowledge regarding the definition of a force learned from textbooks: “A force is a push or
a pull that ... The direction of a push is ... The direction of a pull is ...”, then forms a line of reasoning:
“The baby’s hand applies a force to the cabinet door. → This force causes the door to open. → The
direction of this force is toward the baby’s hand.”, and finally arrives at the correct answer: “This
force is a pull.”. Following [41], we formulate the task to output a natural explanation alongside the
predicted answer. In this paper, we train language models to generate lectures and explanations as the
chain of thought (CoT) to mimic the multi-hop reasoning process to answer S CIENCE QA questions.
Our experiments show that current multimodal methods [55, 1, 21, 9, 26, 35] fail to achieve satisfactory performance on S CIENCE QA and do not generate correct explanations. Instead, we find that CoT
can help large language models not only in the few-shot learning setting but also in the fine-tuning
setting. When combined with CoT to generate the lecture and explanation, the fine-tuned UnifiedQA
[19] achieves an improvement of 3.99% as opposed to not using CoT in the fine-tuning stage. The
few-shot GPT-3 model [5] via chain-of-thought prompting can obtain 75.17% on S CIENCE QA with
an improvement of 1.20% compared to the few-shot GPT-3 without CoT. Prompted with CoT, GPT-3
can generate reasonable explanations as evaluated by automated metrics, and promisingly, 65.2%
of explanations meet the gold standard of human evaluations. We also investigate the upper bound
for models to harness explanations by including them in the input. We find that doing so improves
GPT-3’s few-shot performance by 18.96%, suggesting that explanations do aid models and are
currently underutilized in the CoT framework. Further analysis shows that, like humans, language
models benefit from explanations to learn with less data: UnifiedQA with CoT obtains the same
results as UnifiedQA without CoT with only 40% of the training data.
To sum up, our contributions are three-fold: (a) To bridge the gap in existing datasets in the scientific
domain, we build Science Question Answering (S CIENCE QA), a new dataset containing 21,208
multimodal science questions with rich domain diversity. To the best of our knowledge, S CIENCE QA
is the first large-scale multimodal dataset that annotates lectures and explanations for the answers.

(b) We show that CoT benefits large language models in both few-shot and fine-tuning learning by
improving model performance and reliability via generating explanations. (c) We further explore the
upper bound of GPT-3 and show that CoT helps language models learn from fewer data.

Related Work

Visual question answering. Since the task of visual question answering (VQA) was first proposed
in [2], there have been plenty of VQA datasets [56, 58, 23, 11, 15, 12] conducted to facilitate the
research work. Although our S CIENCE QA dataset shares some features with VQA, there are several
main differences between them. First, S CIENCE QA is more challenging than existing VQA datasets
because it contains multimodal contexts and diverse topics in the scientific domain. In addition, most
answers are annotated with lectures and explanations, which makes S CIENCE QA a suitable dataset
for multi-modal question answering and multi-hop reasoning for AI systems. Inspired by the recent
remarkable performance achieved for VQA [33, 32, 10, 9, 26, 8], in this paper, we further extensively
benchmark S CIENCE QA with a wide range of attention-based [1, 33, 21, 9] and Transformer-based
[30, 26, 27, 8] methods.
Datasets for science problems. Science problem solving is a challenging task that requires an AI
system not only to understand the multimodal information from the science curriculum but also to
reason about how to answer the domain-specific questions. Current science problem datasets such
as AI2D [17], DVQA [16], VLQA [52], and FOODWEDS [24] have contributed to multimodal
reasoning in the scientific domain. For example, a portion of VLQA contains multimodal questions
on science subjects. These datasets, however, lack annotated explanations for the answers to reveal
the reasoning steps. Some other datasets annotate the answers in the forms of supporting facts
[37, 20], entailment trees [7], explanation graphs [13], reasoning chains [14]. However, these datasets
are restricted to the single text modality with small data scales and limited topics. Instead, our
S CIENCE QA annotates the answers with grounded lectures and explanations. Besides, S CIENCE QA
features a richer domain diversity across 3 subjects, 26 topics, 127 categories, and 379 skills.
Learning from explanations and few-shot learning. Explanations help humans understand a task
better, and there have been several attempts to show the same for models. For example, the learning
from instruction paradigm [40, 43, 53, 39, 45, 25], where the task level explanation is provided in
the form of instruction, improves model performance significantly. An example of learning from
explanations in the scientific domain is proposed in [51] where the model interprets demonstrative
solutions to solve geometry problems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in few-shot learning,
where language models learn a specific task from a few examples [46, 3]. For instance, [42, 54, 34]
find that explanations in the format of the chain of thought can improve language models’ reasoning
ability in few-shot learning. In this paper, we show that the chain of thought boosts the performance
of large language models like UnifiedQA [19] if the models generate explanations along with the
answer in a fine-tuning way. Furthermore, a few-shot GPT-3 model via chain-of-thought prompting
is able to improve the reasoning performance on S CIENCE QA and generate reasonable explanations.

Dataset

We collect S CIENCE QA, which is a multimodal multiple-choice science question dataset containing
21,208 examples. An example in S CIENCE QA is shown in Figure 1. Given the science question
and multimodal contexts, the task is to select the correct answer from multiple options. Different
from existing datasets [50, 17, 52, 31, 24], S CIENCE QA covers diverse topics across three subjects:
natural science, social science, and language science. Moreover, most questions are annotated with
grounded lectures and detailed explanations. The lecture provides general knowledge that introduces
the background information for solving problems of a similar class. The explanation reveals a
specific reason for the answer. To effectively answer the questions, a model often needs to be able
to understand the multimodal content in the input and extract external knowledge, similar to how
humans do. More importantly, the goal of S CIENCE QA is to aid development of a reliable model that
is capable of generating a coherent chain of thought when arriving at the correct answer to reveal the
multi-step reasoning process. For data collection details, see Appendix A.1.

Data Analysis

Key statistics. We randomly split the dataset into training, validation, and test splits with a ratio of
60:20:20. Each split has 12,726, 4,241, and 4,241 examples, respectively. Table 1 shows the main
statistics of S CIENCE QA. S CIENCE QA has a large set of different questions, totaling up to 9,122.
Out of the 21,208 questions in S CIENCE QA, 10,332 (48.7%) have an image context, 10,220 (48.2%)
have a text context, and 6,532 (30.8%) have both. 83.9% of the questions are annotated with a lecture,
while 91.3% of the questions feature an explanation. The cross-combination of these information
sources diversifies the problem scenario: sometimes the model is given a lot of information from
multiple sources, while at other times, the only source of information is the question itself. This level
of complexity is very common in grade-level science exams.

contexts. 66.11% of the questions have at least one type of context information. The image context
is in the format of diagrams or natural images, which visualize the critical scenario necessary for
question answering or simply illustrate the question for better understanding. Similarly, the textual
context can provide either semantically rich information or a simple hint to the question. Therefore,
models need to be flexible and general to understand these diverse types of contexts.
Domain diversity. Each S CIENCE QA question belongs to one of the three subjects: natural science,
language science, and social science. With each subject, questions are categorized first by the topic
(Biology, Physics, Chemistry, etc.), then by the category (Plants, Cells, Animals, etc.), and finally
by the specific skill (Classify fruits and vegetables as plant parts, Identify countries of Africa, etc.).
S CIENCE QA has a total of 26 topics, 127 categories, and 379 skills. The treemap in Figure 4
visualizes the different subjects, topics, and categories and shows that S CIENCE QA questions are
very diverse, spanning a wide range of domains.

Comparisons with Existing Datasets

Table 2 shows a comparison of S CIENCE QA and other science problem datasets. As shown in the
table, S CIENCE QA is much larger than most other datasets. S CIENCE QA also has the largest set of
images, spans across all 12 grades, contains the longest questions, and has the most diverse input
sources. As opposed to limiting the subject to only natural science, S CIENCE QA also includes social
science and language science, largely adding to the domain diversity of the dataset. Furthermore,
most of the questions in S CIENCE QA are annotated with textual lectures (83.9%) and explanations
(90.5%), which reveal the reasoning path to the correct answer. To the best of our knowledge,
S CIENCE QA is the first large-scale multimodal science question dataset that annotates the answers
with detailed lectures and explanations.

Baselines and Chain-of-Thought Models

In this section, we establish baselines and develop two chain-of-thought models on S CIENCE QA.
4.1

Baselines

Heuristic baselines. The first heuristic baseline is random chance: we randomly select one from the
multiple options. Each trial is completed on the whole test set, and we take three different trials for
an average result. The second heuristic baseline is human performance. We post the task to Amazon
Mechanical Turk and ask workers to answer S CIENCE QA questions. Only workers who obtain a
high school or higher degree and pass the qualification examples are qualified for the study. Each
worker needs to answer a set of 10 test questions, and each question is answered by three different
workers. For more details of the human performance study, see Appendix B.2.
Zero-shot and few-shot baselines. We establish the zero-shot baselines on top of UnifiedQA
[19] and GPT-3 [5]. The zero-shot setup follows the format of QCM→A where the input is the
concatenation of tokens of the question text (Q), the context text (C), and multiple options (M), while
the output is to predict the answer (A) from the option set. We extract the caption from the captioning
model based on ViT [8] and GPT-2 [47] for the image as the visual context. In the few-shot setting, we
follow the standard prompting [4] where in-context examples from the training set are concatenated
before the test instance. These in-context examples serve as an instruction for the language model to
adjust to the specific task in S CIENCE QA.
Fine-tuning baselines. We first consider the fine-tuning baselines from VQA models [1, 21, 55, 9,
22, 35, 26] proposed in recent years. These VQA baselines take the question, the context, and choices
as the textual input, take the image as the visual input, and predict the score distribution over choice
candidates via a linear classifier. In addition, we build the fine-tuning baseline on top of the large
language model UnifiedQA [19]. UnifiedQA takes the textual information as the input and outputs
the answer option. Similarly, the image is converted into a caption that provides the visual semantics
for the language model.
4.2

Language Models with the Chain of Thought

A chain of thought refers to a coherent flow of sentences that reveals the premises and conclusion of
a reasoning problem [54]. A chain of thought clearly decomposes a multi-hop reasoning task into
intermediate steps instead of solving the task in a black-box way. The chain of thought can be the
step-by-step thought process [54] before arriving at the final answer or explanations [41] that come
after the answer. The annotated lectures and explanations in S CIENCE QA serve as demonstrations of
the chain of thought that mimics the multi-step reasoning steps of human beings. In this paper, we
study if large language models can generate reasonable explanations as the chain of thought to reveal
the thought process when answering S CIENCE QA questions. Further, we explore how the chain of
thought can improve the reasoning ability of language models on S CIENCE QA in both few-shot and
fine-tuning learning.
UnifiedQA with the chain of thought. UnifiedQA [19] is a state of the art model for multi-option
question answering. The original architecture of UnifiedQA takes the question and options as the

GPT-3 via chain-of-thought prompting. Recent research work [5, 38, 34] has shown that GPT3 [5] can perform various tasks when provided in-context examples in a standard prompt. Take
multi-option question answering as an example, the standard prompt [36, 57, 29] builds instructions
using in-context examples with components of the question text, options, and the correct answer
text. This style of few-shot learning enables the GPT-3 model to answer specific questions without
parameter updates. Different from standard prompting, we build GPT-3 via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, as shown in Figure 5. To be specific, for each test problem t, we map the prompt
instruction I : {Ii }n , It into a textual format where {Ii }n refers to the instruction set of n-shot
in-context examples from the training set, while It denotes the test instruction. Instead of the way
where the explanation comes before the answer [54], we feed the instruction I into the encoder6

Experiments

5.1

Experimental Setup

Evaluation metrics. The heuristics and VQA baselines treat our S CIENCE QA task as a multi-class
classification problem with multiple options and are evaluated with the accuracy metrics. UnifiedQA
and GPT-3 treat S CIENCE QA as a text generation problem. So the most similar option is selected
as the final prediction to evaluate the question answering accuracy. The generated lectures and
explanations are evaluated by automatic metrics [44, 28, 49] and human scores by annotators.
Implementation details. The VQA baselines are trained for a maximum number of 50 epochs with a
learning rate of 5e−5. We fine-tune the UnifiedQA for 50k iterations and evaluate every 1k iteration.
The training process is stopped following the early stopping strategy with a patience period of three
evaluations. For GPT-3, we use the text-davinci-002 engine, which is the most capable model
version suggested in the official documentation. More details can be found in Appendix B.1.

Results for Question Answering

Table 3 demonstrates the empirical results for Science Question Answering.
VQA baselines. We feed the VQA baseline models with the input of QCM format to predict answers
A. Out of all the VQA models we benchmarked, VisualBERT [26, 27] performs the best on average
(61.87%). Interestingly, Patch-TRM [35] beats VisualBERT in natural science (NAT) and language
science (LAN), and it also performs better in higher-grade questions (67.50% v.s. 59.92%). However,
in the subject of social science (SOC), VisualBERT outperforms Patch-TRM by a large margin
(+22.39%). Such drastic changes in performance might imply that current VQA models are not
generalized to process the challenging questions in S CIENCE QA.
Language models. We evaluate whether large-scale pretraining on text can help language models
learn scientific knowledge and thus perform better on the S CIENCE QA task. For this purpose, we
have tried two of the state-of-the-art pre-trained language models: UnifiedQA and GPT-3.
(i) UnifiedQA. The results show that without any supervised fine-tuning (zero-shot), UnifiedQA
cannot beat any VQA baseline model, while the pretraining does help the model obtain some
scientific knowledge to outperform the random baseline. When fine-tuned with the answer labels in
S CIENCE QA, UnifiedQABASE reports an accuracy of 70.12% on average. By further teaching the
model to generate the answer along with lecture and explanation, the developed language model with
chain-of-thought (UnifiedQABASE (CoT)) brings additional improvements of +3.21% (QCM→AE)
and +3.99% (QCM→ALE). These results show that generating the chain of thought along with the
answer benefits the reasoning ability of language models.
(ii) GPT-3. The positive effect of pretraining is also proved by the surprisingly good results from
GPT-3 in the same zero-shot setting as UnifiedQA. Without any fine-tuning, GPT-3 already reaches
almost the best performance we can get. Interestingly, prompting the GPT-3 with two training
examples with only answers results in a negligible difference. However, if we prompt GPT-3 with
chain-of-thought prompting (QCM→ALE), we obtain the state-of-the-art result so far (75.17%).

Question: What do these two changes have in common?\n
bleaching clothes\n
a piece of apple turning brown\n
Options: (A) Both are only physical changes. (B) Both are caused by cooling. (C) Both are chemical changes. (D) Both are
caused by heating.\n
Answer: The answer is C. BECAUSE: A physical change is a change to a substance that does not change what the substance
is. A physical change only changes the substance’s physical properties, such as its size, shape, or color.\n
A chemical change is a change to a substance that changes what the substance is. A chemical change changes the substance’s
chemical properties, such as its chemical structure.\n
The changes that you listed are both chemical changes.\n
When you bleach clothes, the chemical structure of the fabric changes. This change makes the fabric less likely to hold color.\n
When a piece of fruit turns brown, the chemical structure of the fruit changes. This change makes the fruit taste different.

Human performance. Humans outperform all benchmarks consistently across question classes,
context types, and grades, e.g., a 20.07% gap for questions with the image context (IMG) between
humans and our best performing model. The gap is to be filled by future research on multimodal
reasoning for scientific question answering.

Results for Generated Explanations

One prediction example of GPT-3 (CoT) is visualized in Figure 6. We can see that GPT-3 (CoT)
predicts the correct answer and generates a reasonable lecture and explanation to mimic the human
thought process. We further report automatic metrics (BLEU-1/4 [44], ROUGE-L [44], and (sentence)
8

Similarity [49] to evaluate the generated lectures and explanations, as shown in Table 4. The Similarity
metric computes the cosine-similarity of semantic embeddings between two sentences based on
the Sentence-BERT network [49]. The results show that UnifiedQABASE (CoT) generates the most
similar explanations to the given ones. However, it’s commonly agreed that automatic evaluation
of generated texts only provides a partial view and has to be complemented by a human study. By
asking annotators to rate the relevance, correctness, and completeness of generated explanations, we
find that the explanations generated by GPT-3 (CoT) conform best to human judgment.

Analysis

Blind studies. Blind studies are conducted on top of the modification of the full model, Top-Down [1].
The results achieved in blind studies of Q only and CI only are close to random chance, showing that
the S CIENCE QA dataset is robust and reliable in distribution. The performance drops in Q+M only,
Q+CT +M only, and Q+CI +M only indicate that all input components provide critical information for
answering S CIENCE QA questions.

Prompt types. We study the effect of prompt types and visualize the comparison in Figure 7 (a). It
shows that prompting the GPT-3 model with both lectures and explanations (QCM→ALE) results
in the highest accuracy on average and the smallest variance. In contrast, prompting with only
explanations (QCM→AE) gives the largest variance, resulting in a less stable model.

Number of in-context examples. In Figure 7 (b), we further investigate how different numbers of
training examples encoded in prompts can affect the prediction accuracy. The QCM→ALE prompt
type outperforms or performs comparably the QCM→A type with all numbers of examples. And we
observe the peak performance of QCM→ALE with 2 training examples being prompted. After that,
the accuracy goes down as more training examples are added to the model.
Dynamic sampling. In Table 5, instead of random sampling, we try to dynamically select the
in-context examples to prompt with the same
class as the test sample. However, slight differences in prediction accuracy are observed when
comparing them to simple random sampling.

Positions of lectures and explanations. We study the performance of GPT-3 (CoT) in terms of
different positions of lectures and explanations on 1,000 test examples. The results are shown in
Table 7. There could be huge accuracy decreases if GPT-3 (CoT) predicts lectures and explanations
before answers. It is mainly because if GPT-3 (CoT) is formalized to generate the long lecture and
explanation first, there is a greater chance that it will stop generating the prediction early or use up
the maximum token limits before obtaining the required answer.

CoT learns with fewer data. To study if the chain of
thought helps language models learn more efficiently, we
report the accuracies of UnifiedQA and UnifiedQA (CoT)

UnifiedQA (CoT) benefits language models by learning the

Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we propose S CIENCE QA, a dataset that features 21,208 multi-option questions with
multimodal contexts from the science curriculum. To the best of our knowledge, S CIENCE QA is the
first large-scale multimodal science dataset where most questions are annotated with corresponding
lectures and explanations. We establish various baselines, including recent VQA models and large
language models on S CIENCE QA. We further study if language models can generate reasonable
explanations and then benefit the reasoning ability. Experiments show that UnifiedQA with the chain
of thought can achieve an improvement of 3.99% and few-shot GPT-3 via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting can obtain a satisfactory accuracy of 75.17% on S CIENCE QA. 65.2% of the generated
explanations from GPT-3 (CoT) meet the gold standard by human evaluations.

Dataset Analysis

A.1

Data Collection

Questions in the S CIENCE QA dataset are sourced from open resources managed by IXL Learning,
an online learning platform curated by experts in the field of K-12 education. The dataset includes
problems that align with California Common Core Content Standards. To construct S CIENCE QA, we
downloaded the original science problems and then extracted individual components (e.g. questions,
hints, images, options, answers, lectures, and solutions) from them based on heuristic rules.
We manually removed invalid questions, such as questions that have only one choice, questions that
contain faulty data, and questions that are duplicated, to comply with fair use and transformative
use of the law. If there were multiple correct answers that applied, we kept only one correct answer.
Also, we shuffled the answer options of each question to ensure the choices do not follow any
specific pattern. To make the dataset easy to use, we then used semi-automated scripts to reformat
the lectures and solutions. Therefore, special structures in the texts, such as tables and lists, are
easily distinguishable from simple text passages. Similar to ImageNet, ReClor, and PMR datasets,
S CIENCE QA is available for non-commercial research purposes only and the copyright belongs to
the original authors. To ensure data quality, we developed a data exploration tool to review examples
in the collected dataset, and incorrect annotations were further manually revised by experts. The tool
can be accessed at https://scienceqa.github.io/explore.html.

Question Statistics

Figure 9 (a) is a word cloud showing the most frequently appeared words in the question texts.
Stopping words that do not contain any semantic meaning, such as “what” or “and”, are removed to
give us a clearer view of the semantic range of S CIENCE QA. The diagram shows that S CIENCE QA
covers a wide range of topics, with words from different topics showing up across the cloud.
Figures 9 (b) (c) (d) show the word clouds for each of the three subjects. We can observe from the
word clouds that the words are well-matched to the subject themes. In natural science questions,
words such as “trait”, “magnet”, and “force” appear frequently. Words such as “capital” and “state”
show up frequently in social science questions, whereas words such as “dictionary” and “page” are
common in language science questions.

Subject Statistics

Figure 11 shows the question length distribution of each subject. The three subjects all feature
long-tail distributions in terms of the number of question words. On average, social science questions
are the shortest, while language science questions are the longest. Language science questions are
distributed more evenly than other questions across different numbers of words. These features imply
that the S CIENCE QA dataset is rich in compositional diversity.

Grade Statistics

The grade distribution is shown in Figure 12. The majority of questions come from the middle
level curriculum (i.e., from grade 3 to grade 8) while around 10% are taken from the high school
curriculum (i.e., from grade 9 to grade 12). These high school level questions are close to or at the
difficulty level of the U.S. standardized tests for college admissions. Machine algorithms need to
master a large amount of scientific knowledge and perform complex reasoning in order to perform
well on S CIENCE QA.

Experiments

B.1

Experimental Details

Below are details on the experiments:
• Fine-tuning on the dataset. Fine-tuning baselines (VQA baselines and UnifiedQA) are trained
on the training set, developed on the validation set, and evaluated on the test set.
• Input sizes: For VQA baselines, we set the maximum number of input words or tokens as 100.
• Batch sizes. We use batches of 64 and 4 for VQA baselines and fine-tuned UnifiedQA, respectively.
• Newline character. For language models, the newline separators (\n) in the text are replaced
with \\n when encoding the inputs because \n is normally used as a stop symbol, following the
original works [5, 19].
• Captioning model. We use the tool2 to generate captions for the images in the dataset. The
maximum length of generated captions is 16, the number of beams is 4, and the maximum
number of output tokens is 512.
• Compute resources. We use two GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs for fine-tuning VQA baselines and
UnifiedQA on the dataset.
• Questions without any context. For questions without any context, the context text is replaced
with an empty string.
• GPT-3: Following default settings, we choose temperature, frequency penalty and presence
penalty as 0.0, and top probability as 1.0. All experiments for GPT-3 are run via the online
API. Experiments in Figure 7 are repeated four times with in-context examples listed in Table 9.
Experiments in Table 3, 5, 6, and 7 are conducted using examples with the trial ID of 1.

Human Performance Study

In order to understand how humans perform on S CIENCE QA questions, we used Amazon Mechanical
Turk (AMT) to crowd source answers to the test set. The interface of instructions and one example
of a test question are shown in Figure 13. A total of 4,241 test questions were shuffled and split
into 425 batches, with each batch having 10 questions (excluding the last one). For each batch, we
also randomly added five training questions as exam examples. Each set of 15 questions was then
assigned to 3 AMT workers. Only workers who correctly answer 4 out of the 5 exam examples or
more are qualified for the human performance study. In other words, workers who failed to pass the
qualified exam were eliminated from the analysis. For each set of 15 questions, we provided the
worker with $0.5 per HIT task. At the rate of 3 questions per minute, this amounts to $6.0 per hour.
B.3

Human Evaluation of Generated Explanations

We also evaluated the quality of predictions from GPT-3 (CoT) and UnifiedQA (CoT) by asking
AMT workers to rate the model-generated explanations. The interface is shown in Figure 14. Each
sample’s question text, contexts, choices, and answers were presented, along with the corresponding
explanation generated by language models. The workers were asked to decide whether the proposed
explanation is relevant (is related to the question), correct (gives a correct answer and explanation),

and complete (fully explains the answer). Prediction outputs that contain textual explanations were
grouped into batches of 10, each assigned to 3 workers for evaluation. For each batch, we provided
the workers with a monetary compensation of $0.3. Finally, the human scores for each explanation
were determined by taking a majority vote.
B.4

Case Study and Limitations

Figure 15 shows three examples with correct answers and gold explanations predicted by GPT-3
via chain-of-thought prompting (CoT). We can see that GPT-3 (CoT) not only predicts the correct
answers but also generates reasonable explanations, which follow the multi-hop reasoning process
of human beings. This suggests that large language models like GPT-3 have great promise for
implementing high-level reasoning abilities.
Figure 16 visualizes three more examples with predictions from GPT-3 (CoT). In these examples,
GPT-3 (CoT) is able to predict the correct answers but fails to generate gold explanations. For
example, GPT-3 (CoT) generates an irrelevant explanation because the context text does not include
fine-grained visual information in the image (Figure 16a). In the example shown in Figure 16b,
GPT-3 (CoT) fails to predict the coherent thought chains, where there are an incorrect example and

an incorrect statement for a chemical change. The third example is given in Figure 16c, where the
generated explanation is just a repetition of the input question and the output answer, instead of
following the complete thought chain to arrive at the final answer.
Four failure examples with wrong predicted answers are listed in Figure 17. We extract the image
captions and feed them to the large language model as the visual content input. However, these
captions lack fine-grained semantics and usually do not work well for diagrams, which results in
two failure cases shown in Figure 17a and 17b. Moreover, there exist challenges for large language
models to reason about the questions that require them to understand complex and uncommon
domain knowledge. For example, GPT-3 (CoT) cannot understand accurately the terminology of
personification in language science (Figure 17c) and a series of complex chemical changes happen in
the formation process of dinosaur fossils (Figure 17d).

Broader Impacts

Societal impact. The S CIENCE QA dataset collects science questions sourced from textbooks and is
proposed to diagnose the multimodal understanding and multi-hop reasoning abilities of AI systems.
Due to the nature of data sources, S CIENCE QA does not contain any user usage data or personally
sensitive information such as gender and race. After careful examination of our dataset, to our
best knowledge, we have not found any improper content, such as pornographic information, racial
remarks, or harmful social bias. We adhere to the goal of AI for the common good, and any antisocial
data points will be removed from the dataset based on feedback.

Potential usage. The proposed S CIENCE QA dataset and designed methods in this paper are beneficial to both follow-up research work and real-world applications. S CIENCE QA provides a useful
benchmark for multi-modal learning, multi-hop reasoning, and general artificial intelligence. Besides,
S&RUUHFW$QVZHU1RW&RPSOHWH([SODQDWLRQ
CIENCE QA will contribute to the development of K-12 education applications such as tutoring

Furthermore, the designed methods with the chain of thought investigate the ability of large
language models to mimic the human mind process when reasoning about a challenging task.
