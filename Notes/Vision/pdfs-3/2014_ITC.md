### 6. Input and Representation Constraints

  - Evidence: "We restricted our analysis to one epoch of the task, the foreperiod that begins each trial." (Main text)
- Controlled state during foreperiod (fixation/lever hold):
  - Evidence: "During the foreperiod, the monkey was in a controlled, attentive state awaiting stimulus onset (fixation of eye position for visual tasks, lever hold for the somatosensory task)." (Main text)
- Foreperiod duration constraints and minimal stimulus during foreperiod:
  - Evidence: "the task foreperiod had durations of at least 500 ms with minimal task-related stimulus during the foreperiod (for visual tasks, only a fixation point on the screen)." (Online Methods)
- Completed trials only:
  - Evidence: "Only completed trials were analyzed." (Online Methods)
- Fixed time bin size for autocorrelation:
