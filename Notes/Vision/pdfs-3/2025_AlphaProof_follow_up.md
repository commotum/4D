1. Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 2 (historical mathematics competition problems; 2024 IMO non-geometry problems). [2025_AlphaProof.pdf:869]
2. Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1 (AlphaProof is presented as the single agent trained to find formal proofs and is the core reasoning engine for the IMO non-geometry problems; no task-specific model variants are described in the abstract). [2025_AlphaProof.pdf:869]
3. Task-Model Ratio:
$$
\boxed{
\frac{2\ \text{tasks}}{1\ \text{model}} = 2
}
$$
