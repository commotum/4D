1. Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 800 ARC tasks total (400 training tasks + 400 evaluation tasks from the original ARC problem set). (Abstract, p.1; Methods 2.1 Design, p.2)
2. Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1 model instance (all tasks are ARC puzzles within the same benchmark and share the same input-output format; no task-specific heads or separate task formulations are described). (Abstract, p.1; Introduction, p.1)

$$
\boxed{
\frac{800\ \text{tasks}}{1\ \text{model}} = 800
}
