                                         This paper introduces Adaptive Computation Time (ACT), an algorithm that allows recurrent neu-
                                         ral networks to learn how many computational steps to take between receiving an input and emitting
                                         an output. ACT requires minimal changes to the network architecture, is deterministic and differen-
                                         tiable, and does not add any noise to the parameter gradients. Experimental results are provided for
                                         four synthetic problems: determining the parity of binary vectors, applying binary logic operations,
                                         adding integers, and sorting real numbers. Overall, performance is dramatically improved by the
                                         use of ACT, which successfully adapts the number of computational steps to the requirements of the
                                         problem. We also present character-level language modelling results on the Hutter prize Wikipedia
                                         dataset. In this case ACT does not yield large gains in performance; however it does provide in-
                                         triguing insight into the structure of the data, with more computation allocated to harder-to-predict
                                         transitions, such as spaces between words and ends of sentences. This suggests that ACT or other
                                         adaptive computation methods could provide a generic method for inferring segment boundaries in
                                         sequence data.


                                         1    Introduction
                                         The amount of time required to pose a problem and the amount of thought required to solve it are
                                         notoriously unrelated. Pierre de Fermat was able to write in a margin the conjecture (if not the
                                         proof) of a theorem that took three and a half centuries and reams of mathematics to solve [35].
                                         More mundanely, we expect the effort required to find a satisfactory route between two cities, or the
                                         number of queries needed to check a particular fact, to vary greatly, and unpredictably, from case
                                         to case. Most machine learning algorithms, however, are unable to dynamically adapt the amount
                                         of computation they employ to the complexity of the task they perform.
                                             For artificial neural networks, where the neurons are typically arranged in densely connected
                                         layers, an obvious measure of computation time is the number of layer-to-layer transformations the
                                         network performs. In feedforward networks this is controlled by the network depth, or number of
                                         layers stacked on top of each other. For recurrent networks, the number of transformations also
                                         depends on the length of the input sequence — which can be padded or otherwise extended to allow
                                         for extra computation. The evidence that increased depth leads to more performant networks is by
                                         now inarguable [5, 4, 19, 9], and recent results show that increased sequence length can be similarly
                                         beneficial [31, 33, 25]. However it remains necessary for the experimenter to decide a priori on the
                                         amount of computation allocated to a particular input vector or sequence. One solution is to simply


                                                                                          1
make every network very deep and design its architecture in such a way as to mitigate the vanishing
gradient problem [13] associated with long chains of iteration [29, 17]. However in the interests
of both computational efficiency and ease of learning it seems preferable to dynamically vary the
number of steps for which the network ‘ponders’ each input before emitting an output. In this case
the effective depth of the network at each step along the sequence becomes a dynamic function of
the inputs received so far.
    The approach pursued here is to augment the network output with a sigmoidal halting unit
whose activation determines the probability that computation should continue. The resulting halting
distribution is used to define a mean-field vector for both the network output and the internal network
state propagated along the sequence. A stochastic alternative would be to halt or continue according
to binary samples drawn from the halting distribution—a technique that has recently been applied to
scene understanding with recurrent networks [7]. However the mean-field approach has the advantage
of using a smooth function of the outputs and states, with no need for stochastic gradient estimates.
We expect this to be particularly beneficial when long sequences of halting decisions must be made,
since each decision is likely to affect all subsequent ones, and sampling noise will rapidly accumulate
(as observed for policy gradient methods [36]).
    A related architecture known as Self-Delimiting Neural Networks [26, 30] employs a halting
neuron to end a particular update within a large, partially activated network; in this case however a
simple activation threshold is used to make the decision, and no gradient with respect to halting time
is propagated. More broadly, learning when to halt can be seen as a form of conditional computing,
where parts of the network are selectively enabled and disabled according to a learned policy [3, 6].
    We would like the network to be parsimonious in its use of computation, ideally limiting itself to
the minimum number of steps necessary to solve the problem. Finding this limit in its most general
form would be equivalent to determining the Kolmogorov complexity of the data (and hence solving
the halting problem) [21]. We therefore take the more pragmatic approach of adding a time cost to
the loss function to encourage faster solutions. The network then has to learn to trade off accuracy
against speed, just as a person must when making decisions under time pressure. One weakness is
that the numerical weight assigned to the time cost has to be hand-chosen, and the behaviour of the
network is quite sensitive to its value.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows: the Adaptive Computation Time algorithm is
presented in Section 2, experimental results on four synthetic problems and one real-world dataset
are reported in Section 3, and concluding remarks are given in Section 4.


2    Adaptive Computation Time
Consider a recurrent neural network R composed of a matrix of input weights Wx , a parametric
state transition model S, a set of output weights Wy and an output bias by . When applied to an
input sequence x = (x1 , . . . , xT ), R computes the state sequence s = (s1 , . . . , sT ) and the output
sequence y = (y1 , . . . , yT ) by iterating the following equations from t = 1 to T :

                                          st = S(st−1 , Wx xt )                                       (1)
                                          yt = Wy st + by                                             (2)

The state is a fixed-size vector of real numbers containing the complete dynamic information of the
network. For a standard recurrent network this is simply the vector of hidden unit activations. For
a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) [14], the state also contains the activations of the
memory cells. For a memory augmented network such as a Neural Turing Machine (NTM) [10],
the state contains both the complete state of the controller network and the complete state of the
memory. In general some portions of the state (for example the NTM memory contents) will not be
visible to the output units; in this case we consider the corresponding columns of Wy to be fixed to
0.


                                                    2
   Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) modifies the conventional setup by allowing R to perform a
variable number of state transitions and compute a variable number of outputs at each input step.
Let N (t) be the total number of updates performed at step t. Then define the intermediate state
                         N (t)                                                N (t)
sequence (s1t , . . . , st ) and intermediate output sequence (yt1 , . . . , yt ) at step t as follows
                                           (
                                       n     S(st−1 , x1t ) if n = 1
                                      st =                                                             (3)
                                             S(sn−1
                                                 t   , xnt ) otherwise
                                     ytn = Wy snt + by                                                    (4)

where xnt = xt + δn,1 is the input at time t augmented with a binary flag that indicates whether the
input step has just been incremented, allowing the network to distinguish between repeated inputs
and repeated computations for the same input. Note that the same state function is used for all
state transitions (intermediate or otherwise), and similarly the output weights and bias are shared
for all outputs. It would also be possible to use different state and output parameters for each
intermediate step; however doing so would cloud the distinction between increasing the number of
parameters and increasing the number of computational steps. We leave this for future work.
    To determine how many updates R performs at each input step an extra sigmoidal halting unit
h is added to the network output, with associated weight matrix Wh and bias bh :

                                             hnt = σ (Wh snt + bh )                                       (5)

As with the output weights, some columns of Wh may be fixed to zero to give selective access to the
network state. The activation of the halting unit is then used to determine the halting probability
pnt of the intermediate steps:
                                          (
                                           R(t) if n = N (t)
                                    pnt =                                                       (6)
                                           hnt otherwise

where                                                             0
                                                              n
                                                              X
                                                          0
                                    N (t) = min{n :                    hnt >= 1 − }                      (7)
                                                              n=1

the remainder R(t) is defined as follows
                                                                  N (t)−1
                                                                      X
                                             R(t) = 1 −                      hnt                          (8)
                                                                      n=1

and  is a small constant (0.01 for the experiments in this paper), whose purpose is to allow compu-
tation to halt after a single update if h1t >= 1 − , as otherwise a minimum of two updates would
                                                                                    PN (t) n
be required for every input step. It follows directly from the definition that        n=1 pt = 1 and
0 ≤ pnt ≤ 1 ∀n, so this is a valid probability distribution. A similar distribution was recently used
to define differentiable push and pop operations for neural stacks and queues [11].
    At this point we could proceed stochastically by sampling n̂ from pnt and setting st = sn̂t , y t = ytn̂ .
However we will eschew sampling techniques and the associated problems of noisy gradients, instead
using pnt to determine mean-field updates for the states and outputs:
                                            N (t)                            N (t)
                                            X                                X
                                     st =           pnt snt           yt =           pnt ytn              (9)
                                            n=1                              n=1

The implicit assumption is that the states and outputs are approximately linear, in the sense that
a linear interpolation between a pair of state or output vectors will also interpolate between the

properties the vectors embody. There are several reasons to believe that such an assumption is
reasonable. Firstly, it has been observed that the high-dimensional representations present in neu-
ral networks naturally tend to behave in a linear way [32, 20], even remaining consistent under
arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction [22]. Secondly, neural networks have been
successfully trained under a wide range of adversarial regularisation constraints, including sparse
internal states [23], stochastically masked units [28] and randomly perturbed weights [1]. This leads
us to believe that the relatively benign constraint of approximately linear representations will not
be too damaging. Thirdly, as training converges, the tendency for both mean-field and stochastic
latent variables is to concentrate all the probability mass on a single value. In this case that yields a
standard RNN with each input duplicated a variable, but deterministic, number of times, rendering
the linearity assumption irrelevant.
    A diagram of the unrolled computation graph of a standard RNN is illustrated in Figure 1, while
Figure 2 provides the equivalent diagram for an RNN trained with ACT.

2.1       Limiting Computation Time
If no constraints are placed on the number of updates R can take at each step it will naturally
tend to ‘ponder’ each input for as long as possible (so as to avoid making predictions and incurring
errors). We therefore require a way of limiting the amount of computation the network performs.
Given a length T input sequence x, define the ponder sequence (ρ1 , . . . , ρT ) of R as

                                                 ρt = N (t) + R(t)                                                 (10)

and the ponder cost P(x) as
                                                               T
                                                               X
                                                   P(x) =                ρt                                        (11)
                                                                   t=1

Since R(t) ∈ (0, 1), P(x) is an upper bound on the (non-differentiable) property we ultimately want
                                           PT
to reduce, namely the total computation t=1 N (t) during the sequence1 .
    We can encourage the network to minimise P(x) by modifying the sequence loss function L(x, y)
used for training:
                                     L̂(x, y) = L(x, y) + τ P(x)                               (12)
where τ is a time penalty parameter that weights the relative cost of computation versus error. As
we will see in the experiments section the behaviour of the network is quite sensitive to the value
of τ , and it is not obvious how to choose a good value. If computation time and prediction error
can be meaningfully equated (for example if the relative financial cost of both were known) a more
principled technique for selecting τ should be possible.
    To prevent very long sequences at the beginning of training (while the network is learning how
to use the halting unit) the bias term bh can be initialised to a positive value. In addition, a hard
limit M on the maximum allowed value of N (t) can be imposed to avoid excessive space and time
costs. In this case Equation (7) is modified to
                                                                         0
                                                                     n
                                                                     X
                                                               0
                                 N (t) = min{M, min{n :                       hnt >= 1 − }}                       (13)
                                                                    n=1


2.2       Error Gradients
The ponder costs ρt are discontinuous with respect to the halting probabilities at the points where
N (t) increments or decrements (that is, when the summed probability mass up to some n either
decreases below or increases above 1 − ). However they are continuous away from those points,
as N (t) remains constant and R(t) is a linear function of the probabilities. In practice we simply
ignore the discontinuities by treating N (t) as constant and minimising R(t) everywhere.
    Given this approximation, the gradient of the ponder cost with respect to the halting activations
is straightforward:

              PN (t) n
then set ρt =   n=1 npt — i.e. the expected ponder time under the stochastic distribution. However experiments
show that networks trained to minimise expected rather than total halting time learn to ‘cheat’ in the following
ingenious way: they set h1t to a value just below the halting threshold, then keep hn  t = 0 until some N (t) when they
      N (t)                                              N (t)
set ht    high enough to ensure they halt. In this case pt    p1t , so the states and outputs at n = N (t) have much
lower weight in the mean field updates (Equation (9)) than those at n = 1; however by making the magnitudes of the
states and output vectors much larger at N (t) than n = 1 the network can still ensure that the update is dominated
by the final vectors, despite having paid a low ponder penalty.

Thereafter the network can be differentiated as usual (e.g. with backpropagation through time [36])
and trained with gradient descent.


3    Experiments
We tested recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with and without ACT on four synthetic tasks and one
real-world language processing task. LSTM was used as the network architecture for all experiments
except one, where a simple RNN was used. However we stress that ACT is equally applicable to
any recurrent architecture.
    All the tasks were supervised learning problems with discrete targets and cross-entropy loss.
The data for the synthetic tasks was generated online and cross-validation was therefore not needed.
Similarly, the character prediction dataset was sufficiently large that the network did not overfit.
The performance metric for the synthetic tasks was the sequence error rate: the fraction of examples
where any mistakes were made in the complete output sequence. This metric is useful as it is trivial
to evaluate without decoding. For character prediction the metric was the average log-loss of the
output predictions, in units of bits per character.
    Most of the training parameters were fixed for all experiments: Adam [18] was used for optimi-
sation with a learning rate of 10−4 , the Hogwild! algorithm [24] was used for asynchronous training
with 16 threads; the initial halting unit bias bh mentioned in Equation (5) was 1; the  term from
Equation (7) was 0.01. The synthetic tasks were all trained for 1M iterations, where an iteration




                                                     6
Figure 3: Parity training Example. Each sequence consists of a single input and target vector. Only 8 of the 64 input bits
are shown for clarity.



is defined as a weight update on a single thread (hence the total number of weight updates is ap-
proximately 16 times the number of iterations). The character prediction task was trained for 10K
iterations. Early stopping was not used for any of the experiments.
    A logarithmic grid search over time penalties was performed for each experiment, with 20 ran-
domly initialised networks trained for each value of τ . For the synthetic problems the range of the
grid search was from i × 10−j with integer i in the range 1–10 and the exponent j in the range 1–4.
For the language modelling task, which took many days to complete, the range of j was limited to
1–3 to reduce training time (lower values of τ , which naturally induce more pondering, tend to give
greater data efficiency but slower wall clock training time).
    Unless otherwise stated the maximum computation time M (Equation (13)) was set to 100. In
all experiments the networks converged on learned values of N (t) that were far less than M , which
functions mainly as safeguard against excessively long ponder times early in training.

3.1     Parity
Determining the parity of a sequence of binary numbers is a trivial task for a recurrent neural
network [27], which simply needs to implement an internal switch that changes sign every time
a one is received. For shallow feedforward networks receiving the entire sequence in one vector,
however, the number of distinct input patterns, and hence difficulty of the task, grows exponentially
with the number of bits. We gauged the ability of ACT to infer an inherently sequential algorithm
from statically presented data by presenting large binary vectors to the network and asking it to
determine the parity. By varying the number of binary bits for which parity must be calculated we
were also able to assess ACT’s ability to adapt the amount of computation to the difficulty of the
vector.
    The input vectors had 64 elements, of which a random number from 1 to 64 were randomly set
to 1 or −1 and the rest were set to 0. The corresponding target was 1 if there was an odd number
of ones and 0 if there was an even number of ones. Each training sequence consisted of a single
input and target vector, an example of which is shown in Figure 3. The network architecture was
a simple RNN with a single hidden layer containing 128 tanh units and a single sigmoidal output
unit, trained with binary cross-entropy loss on minibatches of size 128. Note that without ACT the
recurrent connection in the hidden layer was never used since the data had no sequential component,
and the network reduced to a feedforward network with a single hidden layer.
    Figure 4 demonstrates that the network was unable to reliably solve the problem without ACT,
with a mean of almost 40% error compared to 50% for random guessing. For penalties of 0.03 and
below the mean error was below 5%. Figure 5 reveals that the solutions were both more rapid and
more accurate with lower time penalties. It also highlights the relationship between the time penalty,
the classification error rate and the average ponder time per input. The variance in ponder time
for low τ networks is very high, indicating that many correct solutions with widely varying runtime
can be discovered. We speculate that progressively higher τ values lead the network to compute

Figure 4: Parity Error Rates. Bar heights show the mean error rates for different time penalties at the end of training.
The error bars show the standard error in the mean.

individual runs. Bold lines show the mean errors over all 20 runs for each τ value. ‘Iterations’ is the number of gradient
updates per asynchronous worker. Right: Small circles represent individual runs after training is complete, large circles

surrounding the mean values represents the standard error over error rates for that value of τ , while the width shows the

the parities of successively larger chunks of the input vector at each ponder step, then iteratively
combine these calculations to obtain the parity of the complete vector.
    Figure 6 shows that for the networks without ACT and those with overly high time penalties, the
error rate increases sharply with the difficulty of the task (where difficulty is defined as the number
of bits whose parity must be determined), while the amount of ponder remains roughly constant.
For the more successful networks, with intermediate τ values, ponder time appears to grow linearly
with difficulty, with a slope that generally increases as τ decreases. Even for the best networks the
error rate increased somewhat with difficulty. For some of the lowest τ networks there is a dramatic
increase in ponder after about 32 bits, suggesting an inefficient algorithm.

3.2     Logic
Like parity, the logic task tests if an RNN with ACT can sequentially process a static vector.
Unlike parity it also requires the network to internally transfer information across successive input
timesteps, thereby testing whether ACT can propagate coherent internal states.
    Each input sequence consists of a random number from 1 to 10 of size 102 input vectors. The
first two elements of each input represent a pair of binary numbers; the remainder of the vector
is divided up into 10 chunks of size 10. The first B chunks, where B is a random number from

1 to 10, contain one-hot representations of randomly chosen numbers between 1 and 10; each of
these numbers correspond to an index into the subset of binary logic gates whose truth tables are
listed in Table 1. The remaining 10 − B chunks were zeroed to indicate that no further binary
operations were defined for that vector. The binary target bB+1 for each input is the truth value
yielded by recursively applying the B binary gates in the vector to the two initial bits b1 , b0 . That
is for 1 ≤ b ≤ B:
                                        bi+1 = Ti (bi , bi−1 )                                      (21)
where Ti (., .) is the truth table indexed by chunk i in the input vector.
    For the first vector in the sequence, the two input bits b0 , b1 were randomly chosen to be false (0)
or true (1) and assigned to the first two elements in the vector. For subsequent vectors, only b1 was
random, while b0 was implicitly equal to the target bit from the previous vector (for the purposes
of calculating the current target bit), but was always set to zero in the input vector. To solve the
task, the network therefore had to learn both how to calculate the sequence of binary operations
represented by the chunks in each vector, and how to carry the final output of that sequence over
to the next timestep. An example input-target sequence pair is shown in Figure 7.
    The network architecture was single-layer LSTM with 128 cells. The output was a single sigmoidal
unit, trained with binary cross-entropy, and the minibatch size was 16.
    Figure 8 shows that the network reaches a minimum sequence error rate of around 0.2 without
ACT (compared to 0.5 for random guessing), and virtually zero error for all τ ≤ 0.01. From Figure 9
it can be seen that low τ ACT networks solve the task very quickly, requiring about 10,000 training
iterations. For higher τ values ponder time reduces to 1, at which point the networks trained with
ACT behave identically to those without. For lower τ values, the spread of ponder values, and
hence computational cost, is quite large. Again we speculate that this is due to the network learning
more or less ‘chunked’ solutions in which composite truth table are learned for multiple successive
logic operations. This is somewhat supported by the clustering of the lowest τ networks around a
ponder time of 5–6, which is approximately the mean number of logic gates applied per sequence,



                                                            9
Figure 7: Logic training Example. Both the input and target sequences consist of 3 vectors. For simplicity only 2 of the 10
possible logic gates represented in the input are shown, and each is restricted to one of the first 3 gates in Table 1 (NOR,
Xq, and ABJ). The segmentation of the input vectors is show on the left and the recursive application of Equation (21)
required to determine the targets (and subsequent b0 values) is shown in italics above the target vectors.




                                               Figure 8: Logic Error Rates.



and hence the minimum number of computations the network would need if calculating single binary
operations at a time.
    Figure 10 shows a surprisingly high ponder time for the least difficult inputs, with some networks
taking more than 10 steps to evaluate a single logic gate. From 5 to 10 logic gates, ponder gradually
increases with difficulty as expected, suggesting that a qualitatively different solution is learned for
the two regimes. This is supported by the error rates for the non ACT and high τ networks, which
increase abruptly after 5 gates. It may be that 5 is the upper limit on the number of successive
gates the network can learn as a single composite operation, and thereafter it is forced to apply an
iterative algorithm.

3.3     Addition
The addition task presents the network with a input sequence of 1 to 5 size 50 input vectors. Each
vector represents a D digit number, where D is drawn randomly from 1 to 5, and each digit is drawn
randomly from 0 to 9. The first 10D elements of the vector are a concatenation of one-hot encodings
of the D digits in the number, and the remainder of the vector is set to 0. The required output
is the cumulative sum of all inputs up to the current one, represented as a set of 6 simultaneous
classifications for the 6 possible digits in the sum. There is no target for the first vector in the
sequence, as no sums have yet been calculated. Because the previous sum must be carried over by
the network, this task again requires the internal state of the network to remain coherent. Each
classification is modelled by a size 11 softmax, where the first 10 classes are the digits and the 11th
is a special marker used to indicate that the number is complete. An example input-target pair is
shown in Figure 11.
    The network was single-layer LSTM with 512 memory cells. The loss function was the joint
cross-entropy of all 6 targets at each time-step where targets were present and the minibatch size

class, marked ‘*’, is used for digits beyond the end of the target number.

was 32. The maximum ponder M was set to 20 for this task, as it was found that some networks
had very high ponder times early in training.
     The results in Figure 12 show that the task was perfectly solved by the ACT networks for all
values of τ in the grid search. Unusually, networks with higher τ solved the problem with fewer
training examples. Figure 14 demonstrates that the relationship between the ponder time and the
number of digits was approximately linear for most of the ACT networks, and that for the most
efficient networks (with the highest τ values) the slope of the line was close to 1, which matches our
expectations that an efficient long addition algorithm should need one computation step per digit.
     Figure 15 shows how the ponder time is distributed during individual addition sequences, pro-
viding further evidence of an approximately linear-time long addition algorithm.

3.4    Sort
The sort task requires the network to sort sequences of 2 to 15 numbers drawn from a standard
normal distribution in ascending order. The experiments considered so far have been designed to
favour ACT by compressing sequential information into single vectors, and thereby requiring the
use of multiple computation steps to unpack them. For the sort task a more natural sequential
representation was used: the random numbers were presented one at a time as inputs, and the
required output was the sequence of indices into the number sequence placed in sorted order; an
example is shown in Figure 16. We were particularly curious to see how the number of ponder steps
scaled with the number of elements to be sorted, knowing that efficient sorting algorithms have
O(N log N ) computational cost.
    The network was single-layer LSTM with 512 cells. The output layer was a size 15 softmax,

show the total number of digits in the two numbers being summed at each step; this appears to give a rough lower bound
on the ponder time, suggesting an internal algorithm that is approximately linear in the number of digits. All plots were

trained with cross-entropy to classify the indices of the sorted inputs. The minibatch size was 16.
    Figure 17 shows that the advantage of using ACT is less dramatic for this task than the previous
three, but still substantial (from around 12% error without ACT to around 6% for the best τ value).
However from Figure 18 it is clear that these gains come at a heavy computational cost, with the best
networks requiring roughly 9 times as much computation as those without ACT. Not surprisingly,
Figure 19 shows that the error rate grew rapidly with the sequence length for all networks. It
also indicates that the better networks had a sublinear growth in computations per input step with
sequence length, though whether this indicates a logarithmic time algorithm is unclear. One problem
with the sort task was that the Gaussian samples were sometimes very close together, making it hard
for the network to determine which was greater; enforcing a minimum separation between successive
values would probably be beneficial.
    Figure 20 shows the ponder time during three sort sequences of varying length. As can be seen,
there is a large spike in ponder time near (though not precisely at) the end of the input sequence,
presumably when the majority of the sort comparisons take place. Note that the spike is much higher
for the longer two sequences than the length 5 one, again pointing to an algorithm that is nonlinear

in sequence length (the average ponder per timestep is nonetheless lower for longer sequences, as
little pondering is done away from the spike.).

3.5     Wikipedia Character Prediction
The Wikipedia task is character prediction on text drawn from the Hutter prize Wikipedia dataset [15].
Following previous RNN experiments on the same data [8], the raw unicode text was used, including
XML tags and markup characters, with one byte presented per input timestep and the next byte
predicted as a target. No validation set was used for early stopping, as the networks were unable to
overfit the data, and all error rates are recorded on the training set. Sequences of 500 consecutive
bytes were randomly chosen from the training set and presented to the network, whose internal state
was reset to 0 at the start of each sequence.
    LSTM networks were used with a single layer of 1500 cells and a size 256 softmax classification
layer. As can be seen from Figures 21 and 22, the error rates are fairly similar with and without
ACT, and across values of τ (although the learning curves suggest that the ACT networks are
somewhat more data efficient). Furthermore the amount of ponder per input is much lower than for
the other problems, suggesting that the advantages of extra computation were slight for this task.
    However Figure 23 reveals an intriguing pattern of ponder allocation while processing a sequence.
Character prediction networks trained with ACT consistently pause at spaces between words, and
pause for longer at ‘boundary’ characters such as commas and full stops. We speculate that the extra
computation is used to make predictions about the next ‘chunk’ in the data (word, sentence, clause),
much as humans have been found to do in self-paced reading experiments [16]. This suggests that
ACT could be useful for inferring implicit boundaries or transitions in sequence data. Alternative
measures for inferring transitions include the next-step prediction loss and predictive entropy, both
of which tend to increase during harder predictions. However, as can be seen from the figure, they



                                                           15

are a less reliable indicator of boundaries, and are not likely to increase at points such as full stops
and commas, as these are invariably followed by space characters. More generally, loss and entropy
only indicate the difficulty of the current prediction, not the degree to which the current input is
likely to impact future predictions.
    Furthermore Figure 24 reveals that, as well as being an effective detector of non-text transition
markers such as the opening brackets of XML tags, ACT does not increase computation time during
random or fundamentally unpredictable sequences like the two ID numbers. This is unsurprising,
as doing so will not improve its predictions. In contrast, both entropy and loss are inevitably high
for unpredictable data. We are therefore hopeful that computation time will provide a better way
to distinguish between structure and noise (or at least data perceived by the network as structure
or noise) than existing measures of predictive difficulty.


4     Conclusion
This paper has introduced Adaptive Computation time (ACT), a method that allows recurrent
neural networks to learn how many updates to perform for each input they receive. Experiments on

synthetic data prove that ACT can make otherwise inaccessible problems straightforward for RNNs
to learn, and that it is able to dynamically adapt the amount of computation it uses to the demands
of the data. An experiment on real data suggests that the allocation of computation steps learned
by ACT can yield insight into both the structure of the data and the computational demands of
predicting it.
    ACT promises to be particularly interesting for recurrent architectures containing soft attention
modules [2, 10, 34, 12], which it could enable to dynamically adapt the number of glances or internal
operations they perform at each time-step.
    One weakness of the current algorithm is that it is quite sensitive to the time penalty parameter
that controls the relative cost of computation time versus prediction error. An important direction
for future work will be to find ways of automatically determining and adapting the trade-off between
accuracy and speed.
