1. Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 1 — ARC-AGI grid transformation / solving ARC input→output grid puzzles (transform input grids into output grids). (2024_EvoTTC.pdf:164)
2. Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1 — a single Sonnet 3.5 model instance is used for the reported results and to generate/evolve the transform functions. (2024_EvoTTC.pdf:164)

$$
\boxed{
\frac{1\ \text{task}}{1\ \text{model}} = 1
}
