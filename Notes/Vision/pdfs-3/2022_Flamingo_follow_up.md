Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 18. The paper states it chose 16 multimodal image/video + language benchmarks and also includes two standard classification benchmarks (ImageNet and Kinetics), with the full task list summarized in Table 6. (2022_Flamingo.pdf p.30; 2022_Flamingo.pdf p.31, Table 6)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1. A single Flamingo model is used across the wide array of tasks via few-shot prompting, using a single set of model weights. (2022_Flamingo.pdf p.7, Table 1 caption; 2022_Flamingo.pdf p.7, Section 3.1)

$$
\boxed{
\frac{18\ \text{tasks}}{1\ \text{model}} = 18
}
