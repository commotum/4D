Distinct tasks evaluated: 10 (passkey retrieval; language modeling/perplexity on Pile; GovReport summarization; LongEval lines task; LongBench tasks: single-document QA, multi-document QA, few-shot learning, synthesis tasks, code completion; and Ruler NIAH retrieval). (p. 7-9, 19-20, 28)

Trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1 (Mesa-Extrapolation is a plug-in that does not require additional training or fine-tuning; no task-specific heads are described). (p. 1, 7)

$$
\boxed{
\frac{10\ \text{tasks}}{1\ \text{model}} = 10
}
