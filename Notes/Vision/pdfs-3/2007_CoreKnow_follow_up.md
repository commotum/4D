1. Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 0. The article is a conceptual synthesis of prior work across infants, non-human primates, children, and adults, describing converging research and prior studies that provide evidence for core knowledge systems rather than reporting new task evaluations or datasets. Evidence: "Converging research on human infants, non-human primates, children and adults in diverse cultures can aid both understanding of these systems and attempts to overcome their limits." (Abstract, p. 89) and "Studies of human infants and non-human animals, focused on the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of knowledge, provide evidence for four core knowledge systems." (Introduction, p. 89)

2. Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 0. The paper does not introduce or train any computational model; it discusses core knowledge systems and reviews empirical evidence from human and animal studies. Evidence: the paper frames its claims as a synthesis of existing research across populations rather than describing new model training (Abstract, p. 89; Introduction, p. 89).

3. Task-Model Ratio:

$$
\boxed{
\frac{0\ \text{tasks}}{0\ \text{models}} = \text{N/A}
}
