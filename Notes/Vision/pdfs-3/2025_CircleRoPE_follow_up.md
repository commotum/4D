Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 9. Tasks counted: MMMU, MMMU-Pro, MathVista (mini), MMStar, AI2D, RealWorldQA, InfoVQA (Table 2, p.8); ChartQA (Table 4, p.8); MathVision (Table 6, p.13).

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1. The paper reports a unified training setup with only the positional encoding modified relative to the baseline, which supports evaluating the same trained model across tasks (Sec. 5.1, p.7).

$$
\boxed{
\frac{9\ \text{tasks}}{1\ \text{model}} = 9
}
