## 2. One-Sentence Contribution Summary
The thesis determines transport properties of driven granular systems using analytic kinetic-theory methods and Monte Carlo simulations.
- Evidence: "In this work, we determine the transport properties of driven granular systems by using two independent and complementary routes, one of them being analytic (Chapman-Enskog method, BGK solution and Grad’s moments method) and the other one being computational (Monte Carlo simulations)." (Abstract)

## 3. Tasks Evaluated
Task 1: Homogeneous steady states of driven granular fluids.
- Task type: Other (kinetic-theory analysis of steady states)
- Dataset(s): Not specified in the paper.
- Domain: granular gases / inelastic hard spheres.
- Evidence (task): "Homogeneous steady states of a driven granular fluid are analyzed in Chapter 3." (Chapter 1.3 Structure of the Thesis)
- Evidence (domain): "Granular matter under rapid flow conditions can be modeled as a granular gas, namely, a gas of hard spheres dissipating part of their kinetic energy during binary collisions (inelastic hard spheres, IHS)." (Abstract)

- Task type: Other (transport-coefficient derivation)
- Dataset(s): Not specified in the paper.

- Task type: Other (transport-coefficient derivation in kinetic theory)
- Dataset(s): Not specified in the paper.
- Domain: dilute granular gases modeled by IMM.
- Evidence (task): "In Chapter 5 we propose a possible way of circumventing these technical difficulties inherent to IHS, by considering instead the so-called Inelastic Maxwell Models (IMM) for dilute granular gases." (Chapter 1.3 Structure of the Thesis)
- Evidence (task): "Thus, in this Chapter, we determine in the steady state the exact forms of the shear viscosity η, the thermal conductivity κ and the transport coefficient µ (that relates the heat flux with the density gradient) as a function of the coefficient of restitution α and the thermostat forces." (Chapter 1.3 Structure of the Thesis)

Task 4: Uniform shear flow (USF) in a gas-solid suspension.
- Task type: Other (non-Newtonian hydrodynamics / rheology)
- Dataset(s): Not specified in the paper.
- Domain: gas-solid suspension at low density.
- Evidence (task): "In Chapter 6 we study a steady laminar shear flow with null heat flux, usually called Uniform Shear Flow (USF), in a gas-solid suspension at low density." (Chapter 1.3 Structure of the Thesis)

## 12. Explicit Limitations and Non-Claims
- Limitation about boundary-driven modeling: "...the relationship of the last external force with real vibrating walls is not clear to date..." (Chapter 7.2 Outlooks)
- Need for more comparisons before conclusions: "...more comparisons between kinetic theory results for heated granular gases and computer simulations performed in realistic vibrating beds are needed before qualitative conclusions can be drawn." (Chapter 7.2 Outlooks)
- Future work on other flows: "we expect in the near future to extend the present results to other related flows such as the so-called LTu flows... or to the more general class of Couette flows" (Chapter 7.2 Outlooks)
- Future work on multicomponent suspensions: "We want also to carry out further studies on the more realistic case of multi-component granular suspensions where problems like segregation can be addressed." (Chapter 7.2 Outlooks)
- Simulation limitation: "This second branch... could not be reached numerically due to the limitations of our uniform DSMC simulations." (Chapter 7.2 Outlooks)
- Planned future simulations: "In order to test this branch, new non-uniform DSMC or MD simulation will be carried out in the future." (Chapter 7.2 Outlooks)
