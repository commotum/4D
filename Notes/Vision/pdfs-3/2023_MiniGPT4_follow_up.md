Trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1.
Evidence: MiniGPT-4 is a single model with one projection layer and a two-stage training pipeline (Section 3, p.3-4), and that single MiniGPT-4 is reported to demonstrate the full set of capabilities across the tasks listed in Section 4 (e.g., Section 4.1, p.5).
