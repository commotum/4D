Abstract— Understanding the real world through point cloud
video is a crucial aspect of robotics and autonomous driving
systems. However, prevailing methods for 4D point cloud
recognition have limitations due to sensor resolution, which
leads to a lack of detailed information. Recent advances have
shown that Vision-Language Models (VLM) pre-trained on
web-scale text-image datasets can learn fine-grained visual
concepts that can be transferred to various downstream tasks.
However, effectively integrating VLM into the domain of 4D
point clouds remains an unresolved problem. In this work,
we propose the Vision-Language Models Goes 4D (VG4D)
framework to transfer VLM knowledge from visual-text pretrained models to a 4D point cloud network. Our approach
involves aligning the 4D encoder’s representation with a VLM
to learn a shared visual and text space from training on
large-scale image-text pairs. By transferring the knowledge
of the VLM to the 4D encoder and combining the VLM,
our VG4D achieves improved recognition performance. To
enhance the 4D encoder, we modernize the classic dynamic point
cloud backbone and propose an improved version of PSTNet,
im-PSTNet, which can efficiently model point cloud videos.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-ofthe-art performance for action recognition on both the NTU
RGB+D 60 dataset and the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset. Code is

I. I NTRODUCTION
Recently, robotics and autonomous driving systems have
used real-time depth sensors such as LiDARs to achieve
3D perception [1]–[4]. Point clouds from LiDARs can provide rich geometric information and facilitate the machine’s
comprehension of environmental perception. Early methods [5]–[8] focus on parsing the real world from static point
clouds, neglecting temporal changes. To better understand
the time-varying world, recent research focuses more on
understanding point cloud videos in 4D, encompassing three
spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension. Several
works [9], [10] have been done in 4D point cloud modeling.

These methods either aim to design improved networks for
modeling 4D point clouds or employ self-supervised methods
to enhance the efficiency of 4D point cloud representations.
Nonetheless, the recognition of 4D videos remains a
challenge for machines, primarily due to the inherent characteristics of point cloud data, which lack texture information.
Owing to the lower resolution of LiDARs, point clouds
may lack some details, resulting in the loss of fine-grained
information. The failure recognition case of the traditional
4D point cloud network is shown on the right side of Fig.1.
We find that recognition failures of 4D point clouds occur
due to the small differences between actions. When a person
executes a specific action with limbs, the limb engaged and
the object being manipulated are vital in distinguishing the
action. For example, when differentiating between actions
such as “making a victory sign” and “making an OK sign,”
the texture characteristics of the hand become critical for
precise recognition of the respective actions. On the other
hand, images from the RGB modality lack depth information.
When a person in the video moves deeply, changes in depth
become challenging to discern, leading to confusion between
actions involving depth movement, such as “nod bow” and
others like “vomiting.” In conclusion, point clouds typically
struggle to provide fine-grained information effectively,
and it is difficult for RGB to provide depth information.
Conversely, the rich texture of RGB inherently provides an abundance of fine-grained information, whereas

the presence of depth information is inherent to the
point cloud modality. Recently, Vision-Language Models
(VLM), pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs, were
adept at learning fine-grained visual concepts from RGB
images. Some researches [11]–[15] have successfully applied
the knowledge gleaned from VLMs to 3D static point cloud
and video understanding. However, due to the modality gap,
RGB video and 4D point cloud understanding are treated
as two distinct problems. The RGB video and 4D point
cloud models are constructed with disparate architectures and
trained on varying data types. Currently, the utilization of
RGB video models to recognize 4D point clouds has not
been extensively explored.
Motivated by VLM for point processing and video
understanding [16], [17], we make the first study of VLM
in 4D action understanding within this work. Specifically,
we propose a new VG4D (VLM Goes 4D) framework that
trains a 4D encoder by leveraging VLM’s knowledge. To
jointly fine-tune this 4D encoder, we put forth a cross-modal
contrastive learning approach, which facilitates harmonious
alignment of the 3D representation with the VLM feature
domain. In this manner, the deficiency in fine-grained details
within the point cloud modality is effectively compensated
by rich content information in the RGB modality. Building
on the foundation of VG4D, we synergize the exceptional
capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in video
understanding with 4D point cloud representation to enhance multi-modal action recognition. Specifically, as shown
in Fig. 1(b), after aligning across multiple modalities, we
achieve robust multi-modal action recognition by integrating
multi-modal prediction scores and utilizing text information
as classifiers. In addition, most VLMs are open source and
easy to obtain, and we apply different VLMs integrated into
our proposed VG4D framework, demonstrating the generalization of our proposed method.
Moreover, we revisit PSTNet, the classical and widely
used network in dynamic point cloud modeling. We observe
that a significant portion of the performance improvement
achieved by the state-of-the-art approach compared to PSTNet can be attributed to the enhanced training strategy employed. Through comprehensive experimentation with these
enhancements, we identified pivotal elements contributing
to variations in performance outcomes. Subsequently, we
employed these identified components to revitalize the architecture of PSTNet. As a result, we propose the improved
version of PSTNet dubbed im-PSTNet, and use it as the 4D
encoder for the VG4D framework. Our contributions can be
summarized as follows:
• We propose a novel VG4D framework that aligns 4D
feature space with language-image representation, facilitating point cloud video recognition. To our knowledge,
we are the first to explore transferring VLM’s pretrained knowledge to 4D point cloud understanding.
• We design a 4D encoder, named im-PSTNet, as the encoder of point cloud video, which achieves an effective
point cloud video representation. We combine the robust
characterization capabilities of VLMs with the outstand-

ing point cloud video understanding abilities of the 4D
network to enhance multi-modal action recognition.
• Our proposed VG4D significantly outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on large-scale RGB+D
action recognition datasets.
II. RELATED WORK
Static Point Cloud Processing. Much progress [18] has been
made in the field of static point cloud analysis. Point-based
methods directly process raw point clouds as input. They are
pioneered by PointNet [19], which models the permutation
invariance of points with shared MLPs by point-wised feature
extraction. PointNet++ [6] enhances PointNet by capturing
local geometric structures. Later on, point-based methods [8],
[20], [21] aim at designing local aggregation operators for
local feature extraction. Recently, several methods have
leveraged Transformer-like networks [22], [23] to extract
information via self-attention. Meanwhile, self-supervised
representation learning methods [24]–[27] such as contrastive
learning and reconstruction masks have attracted significant
interest from the community. However, these methods mainly
focus on static point clouds and cannot directly process
dynamic point cloud video due to the lack of the temporal
dynamics of point clouds into account.
4D Point Cloud Modeling. Dynamic 4D point cloud modeling is more challenging than static point cloud processing.
Previous point cloud video recognition methods rely on
convolutional, multi-stream, or vision transformer. Within a
convolutional framework, MeteorNet [28] is the first method
on deep learning for dynamic raw 4D point cloud, which
extends 3D points to 4D points and then appends a temporal
dimension to PointNet++ to process these 4D points. Meanwhile, PSTNet [29], [30] models spatio-temporal information
of raw point cloud videos via decomposing space and time
hierarchically. For multi-stream design, the representative
method 3DV [31] integrates 3D motion information into a
regular compact voxel set and then applies PointNet++ to
extract representations from the set for 3D action recognition.
Some other methods [32]–[37] decouple spatial and temporal information. Recently, P4Transformer [38] and other
methods [39], [40] adopt self-attention module to capture the
long-range spatial-temporal context information. In addition,
recent methods [41], [42] start exploring the application of
self-supervised or semi-supervised learning in dynamic 4D
point cloud modeling. However, owing to the absence of finegrained appearance input, the aforementioned methods still
encounter difficulties in recognition.
Vision-Language Models. Large vision-language models,
comprising an image and a text encoder, are trained on
extensive image-text pairs in a contrastive manner to learn a
shared feature space between images and textual labels. For
example, CLIP is transferable to a variety of downstream
tasks, including point cloud understanding [11], [12], video
understanding [43]–[45], etc. Recently, several studies have
extended the existing CLIP model to the video domain.
AIM [44] reuses the CLIP self-attention as the temporal ones
via an additional adapter module. Vita-CLIP [46] proposed

a multi-modal prompt learning scheme to balance the supervised and zero-shot performance. However, unlike the video
domain, 3D point cloud processing with VLMs is still in its
infancy. PointCLIP [47] directly uses the depth maps of 3D
point clouds as the input of CLIP to perform zero-shot classification. ULIP [16] learns a unified representation among
image, text, and point cloud that enhances 3D representation
learning. Our method is different from PointCLIP and ULIP.
In particular, we aim to use the fine-grained features learned
by VLM to improve 4D point cloud recognition, which can
compensate for the shortcomings of missing details in 3D
point clouds.
III. M ETHOD
In this section, we first give an overview of the proposed
VG4D framework, followed by details on how to train the
network effectively. Then, we describe the design of imPSTNet, which is an improved 4D encoder proposed for
VG4D.
A. Overview of VG4D
As illustrated in Fig. 2, our proposed VG4D framework
consists of 3 networks: 4D point cloud encoder EP , video encoder EV and text encoder ET from VLM. We use languageRGB-4D point cloud triplets to train the framework. The
RGB video and 4D point cloud are obtained from a camera
and depth sensor, which captures data from the same sample.
In addition, the language component consists of textual
descriptions of all possible action categories. We define a
set of N language-RGB video-4D point cloud triplets as
{xiP , xVi , xiT }Ni=1 , where xiP represents 4D point cloud, xVi is
the RGB video, and xiT is the text of action category.

4D encoder takes in a point cloud video as the input. The
output of the 4D encoder is a feature vector that encapsulates
motion details. To maintain congruence in feature dimensions
with other modalities, we introduced an additional projection
layer for the 4D point cloud output. Given a 4D point
cloud xiP , we feed the point cloud video xiP into the 4D
encoder EP to obtain the feature representation in a common
embedding space by projecting the encoded feature to a
common dimension represented by:
fiP = ψP (EP (xiP ))

(1)

where fiP ∈ RCP represent the 4D point cloud embedding
after the projection layers ψP . To better learn action information from the 4D point cloud, we incorporate our customdesigned im-PSTNet as the 4D encoder. A comprehensive
explanation of the im-PSTNet’s particulars will be presented
in Sect.III-C.
VLM takes in the RGB video and action category texts as
the input. In video understanding, VLMs learn to synchronize video representations with their corresponding textual
counterparts through the collaborative training of a video
and text encoder. Formally, given an RGB video clip xVi
and a text description xiT , we feed the video xVi into the
video encoder EV and the text xiT into the text encoder
ET to obtain the feature representation of each sample in a
common embedding space by projecting the encoded feature
to a common dimension represented by:
f V = ψV (EV (xVi )),

f T = ψT (ET (xiT )).

(2)

where f V ∈ RCV and f T ∈ RCT represent the RGB video
and text embedding after the projection layers ψV and ψT ,
respectively. The dimensions of CV , and CT are identical after
passing through the projection layer.

Within the VG4D framework, we employ X-CLIP [17]
as both the text and video encoders. X-CLIP builds upon
CLIP by incorporating cross-frame attention mechanisms
and video-specific hinting techniques. These enhancements
enable the extraction of temporal cross-frame interaction information and the generation of instance-level discriminative
textual representations, respectively.
B. Cross-Modal Learning
To learn more transferable representation from VLM, we
introduce a cross-modal learning objective to jointly optimize
the correlation alignment across language, RGB video, and
4D point cloud. The overall architecture of our method,
shown in Fig. 2, contains language encoder ET , point cloud
encoder EP and visual encoder EV , which respectively embed
the three modalities into text feature f T ∈ RCT , image feature
f V ∈ RCV and point cloud feature f P ∈ RCP , where C is the
embedding dimension. Through normalization, we constrain
the output of each projection network to reside within a
unit hypersphere, enabling us to measure feature similarity using the inner product. Our cross-modal contrastive
learning mainly jointly optimizes the correlation alignment
across languages, images, and point clouds via semanticlevel language-4D alignment and instance-level image-4D
alignment. The core idea of semantic-level language-3D
alignment is to drive the feature of 4D action instances and
the corresponding action category text closer. In a training
mini-batch of size N, with K action categories, we calculate
the loss function between the language and 4D point cloud
as:
exp( fiT · fiP )
1
.
(3)
L(pc,text) = ∑ − log
N i∈N
∑ j∈K exp( f jT · fiP )
We further introduce the contrastive alignment between
instance-wise RGB video and 4D instances. The contrastive
aligned objective L(pc,video) across point cloud and image is
formulated as:
L(pc,video) =

exp( fiV · fiP )
1
− log
.
∑
N i∈N
∑ j∈N exp( f Vj · fiP )

(4)

Finally, we minimize the contrastive loss for all modality
pairs with different coefficients α and β ,
Lcl = αL(pc,video) + β L(pc,text) .

(5)

During cross-modal learning, We use Lcl as supervision to
fine-tune the im-PSTNet model that has been pre-trained to
learn 4D representations. Note that the VLM is frozen at this
stage. Our VG4D also includes two classification heads to
classify the 4D features and RGB video features extracted by
im-PSTNet and Video encoder, respectively. Our final loss
is as follows:
L f inal = Lcl + θ L pc + γLrgb .

(6)

In the testing phase, we ensemble the im-PSTNet with the
VLM. Specifically, we fuse four 4D-text, RGB-text, 4D, and
RGB scores as the final classification result.

C. im-PSTNet
In this subsection, we first briefly review the classical
and widely used network in dynamic point cloud modeling.
Then, we present how we modernize the classical architecture PSTNet [29] into im-PSTNet, the improved version of
PSTNet with effective performance. Finally, we detail the
network structure of im-PSTNet. As depicted in Fig.2, the
im-PSTNet mainly consists of the spatial extractor and imPSTConv units.
Review of PSTNet. PSTNet is a spatial and temporal
decoupled feature extractor for 4D point clouds. PSTNet uses
point spatio-temporal (PST) convolution to extract informative representations of point cloud sequences. The spatiotemporal features are denoted as h(pti ), which are aggregated
in the following manner:
o
n
′
′
(7)
h(pti ) = max ζ ( f tj , (xtj − xti )) .
ptj ∈N(pti )

′

′

where f tj and xtj represent the feature and coordinates
of points in the spatio-temporal neighbors’ points, and ζ
represents the MLP layers.
Our paper focuses on enhancing the 4D point cloud
recognition task by utilizing VLM pre-training knowledge.
To achieve this, we propose the im-PSTNet, an improved
and modernized version of PSTNet, as the 4D backbone of
VG4D.
From PSTNet to im-PSTNet. Our exploration mainly focuses on training strategy modernization and network architecture modernization. We first employ data augmentation
techniques on point cloud video clips. Contrary to PSTNet’s
method of training and testing all potential clip segments, we
employ a data augmentation strategy for frame sampling,
significantly reducing both training and testing durations.
Specifically, we first divide each point cloud video into T
segments with equal duration. During the training phase,
a frame is randomly sampled from each segment, while
in the testing phase, a frame is selected from the middle
position, in each segment. Our experiments show that using
the cosine learning rate decay method can lead to better
training results than using the step decay method used by
PSTNet. As a result, we adopt the cosine learning rate decay
method in our im-PSTNet. In terms of network structure,
we use the radius r of the search neighborhood point to
normalize ∆x = xtj − xti , which will make the value of the
relative coordinates less small, which is conducive to network
optimization. In addition, to better aggregate the features of
the spatio-temporal neighbors, we increase the feature fit of
the center point itself to update the features of each center
point. The spatio-temporal features are aggregated in the
following manner:
n
o
′
′
h(pti ) = max ζ ( f tj , fit , (xtj − xti )/r) .
(8)
ptj ∈N(pti )

′

where f tj and xtj represent the feature and coordinates of
points in the spatio-temporal neighbors’ points, r represents
the radius of searching for spatio-temporal neighbor points,
and ζ represents the MLP layers.

Architecture of im-PSTNet. Spatial extractor is designed
to extract the initial features from the N points in each
frame, which consists of four sub-modules: point sampling,
grouping, MLP layers, and max-pooling. In the point sampling layer, given a spatial subsampling rate Ss , the iterative
farthest point sampling(FPS) method is used to subsample
N points to N ′ = [ sNs ] centroids in each frame. Then the
grouping layer searches for a few neighboring points around
each centroid to construct a local region for the points
subsampled after the FPS. After applying MLP and MAX
pooling, the resulting output will contain the coordinates (xti )
and features (pti ) of each point that has undergone downsampling. im-PSTConv is improved based on point spatiotemporal (PST) convolution [29], used to extract spatiotemporal information. The difference between im-PSTConv
and spatial extractor is that im-PSTConv will group spatiotemporal points by building point pipes. It searches for
spatio-temporal neighbors across frames, so this module is
called a cross-grouping module.
IV. EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we describe the implementation details,
experiment setup, and experimental results.
Dataset. NTU RGB+D [56] is a large-scale benchmark
dataset for action recognition, which contains 56,880 videos
collected from 40 subjects performing 60 different actions
in 80 camera views. The videos are captured using Kinect
V2 to collect four data modalities: RGB frames, depth maps,
3D joint information, and IR sequences. Cross-subject and
cross-view evaluations are adopted. NTU RGB+D 120 [57]
is an extension of NTU60, with 120 action classes and
114,480 videos. The action classes include daily actions,
health-related actions, and mutual actions. This dataset is
also collected with Kinect V2 and shares the same modality

with NTU RGB+D 60 dataset. We use the cross-subject and
cross-setup evaluation protocols on the NTU RGB+D 120
dataset.
Implementation Details. For point cloud data preparation,
we follow PSTNet to convert depth maps to point cloud
sequences, in which we sample 2048 points in each frame.
We use the SGD optimizer with cosine learning rate decay
for optimization. The initial learning rate, the weight decay,
and the batch size are empirically set as 0.01, 0.1, and 32,
respectively. We pre-train 120 epochs on NTU RGB+D 60
and NTU RGB+D 120. The number of neighboring points
K and the spatial search radius r at the grouping module
are set as 9 and 0.1, respectively. Following PSTNet, we
set the clip length and frame sampling stride to 23 and 2,
respectively. For the RGB modality, we set the number of
input frames to 8, using the same frame sampling method in
the point cloud video. We use the pre-trained X-CLIP-B/16
model on Kinetics600 [58] to fine-tune for 30 epochs on the
NTU RGB+D dataset. In contrastive learning, we train for 30
epochs, the learning rate decays from 0.001 to 0.0001, and
the other settings are the same as those of the pre-trained 4D
encoder. All our experiments are performed on two NVIDIA
12G 3080Ti GPUs.

A. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods
In Table I, we compare our proposed method with other
methods on the two datasets. Our im-PSTNet outperforms
other single modal baseline methods under most of the settings on both datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness
of our im-PSTNet for 4D action recognition on large-scale
datasets. Concurrently, our VG4D achieves state-of-the-art
results on multi-modal baseline approaches.

B. Ablation Study
Comparison of Different Losses. We report the effect of
using different losses when fine-tuning im-PSTNet in Table II. Among them, the pc-rgb and pc-text loss represent the
comparative learning loss of point cloud and RGB video and
text, respectively. The cls loss represents the cross-entropy
loss of im-PSTNet. In particular, after removing the two
contrastive learning losses, the accuracy of action recognition
dropped significantly, which proves the effectiveness of the
contrastive learning method we proposed. Comparison of
Different Fusion Methods. To further show the effectiveness of our method, we compare different combinations of
classification scores in Table III. PC, PC-Text, RGB, and
RGB-Text represent the FC classification score of the point
cloud, the comparison score of the point cloud and text, the
FC classification score of RGB, and the comparison score
of RGB and text. CML representation using cross-modal
learning in VG4D.
Comparison of Different Improvements. In Table IV, we
report the results of our proposed 4D encoder im-PSTNet
when using different modules compared to the original
PSTNet. As can be seen from the table, the im-PSTNet has
a greater improvement in 4D action recognition compared to
the PSTNet baseline.
Comparison of Different VLMs. We experiment with
different VLMs under our framework. We report the results
of using X-CLIP and Vita-CLIP pre-trained models and
the effect of integrating our framework in Table V. As
can be seen from the Table, impressive results can also be
achieved using Vita-CLIP. This shows that the framework
we proposed is universal, and we can integrate VLM with
excellent performance into our framework.
C. Further analysis
Hard Cases. Some classification failure cases of im-PSTNet

Fig. 3.

Action classification cases for some different modalities.

are shown in Fig. 3. Recognition failure in point cloud
modalities is often caused by the absence of detailed information, such as hand and object movements, which are crucial
for distinguishing actions that only involve hand movements.
Conversely, RGB mode recognition fails due to the lack of
depth information, which is precisely what the point cloud
mode provides.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explore how VLM knowledge benefits 4D
point cloud understanding. We present a novel VLM goes 4D
framework with an effective 4D backbone named im-PSTNet
to learn better 4D representations. To efficiently transfer
VLM’s image and text features to a 4D network, we propose
a novel cross-modal contrastive learning scheme. Our VG4D
approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various large-scale action recognition datasets. Additionally, our
proposed im-PSTNet can be utilized as a robust baseline for
4D recognition. We hope that this work can inspire action
recognition research in the future.
