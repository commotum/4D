Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 5
- Task 1: Copy (Section 4.1 "Copy")
- Task 2: Repeat Copy (Section 4.2 "Repeat Copy")
- Task 3: Associative Recall (Section 4.3 "Associative Recall")
- Task 4: Dynamic N-Grams (Section 4.4 "Dynamic N-Grams")
- Task 5: Priority Sort (Section 4.5 "Priority Sort")

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 5
- The experimental settings list task-specific configurations for Copy, Repeat Copy, Associative, N-Grams, and Priority Sort, indicating separate trained instances per task rather than a single multi-task model (Section 4.6, Table 1)
