Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 2 (multimodal chatbot; ScienceQA) (2023_LLaVA.pdf, Sec. 5 Experiments: "two primary experimental settings: multimodal chatbot and the ScienceQA dataset").

Number of trained model instances required: 2 (separate fine-tuning scenarios for chatbot vs ScienceQA; chatbot training uses all three response types in one model) (2023_LLaVA.pdf, Sec. 4.2 Training: "We consider two specific use case scenarios: Multimodal Chatbot... Science QA"; "fine-tuning on the 158K language-image instruction-following data"; "They are uniformly sampled in training").

\boxed{
\frac{2\ \text{tasks}}{2\ \text{models}} = 1
