Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 2
- Task 1: Solve a given 9x9 Sudoku grid by completing it with digits 1-9 under row/column/block constraints. (p. 18)
- Task 2: Puzzle classification results produced by the SudoRules 13 solver across >56,000 puzzles (classification results in chapters XXI and XXIII). (p. 409)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1
- A single solver (SudoRules 13) is evaluated and produces the classification results; no separate task-specific model is described. (p. 409)

$$
\boxed{
\frac{2\ \text{tasks}}{1\ \text{model}} = 2
}
