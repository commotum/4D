Number of distinct tasks evaluated: 5
- Frequency-domain analysis of attention distributions (DFT-based frequency analysis). (`Notes/Vision/pdfs-3/2024_WaveletATTN.txt:112`)
- Wavelet decomposition analysis (db2 wavelet). (`Notes/Vision/pdfs-3/2024_WaveletATTN.txt:120`)
- Uncertainty analysis via positional and spectral entropy. (`Notes/Vision/pdfs-3/2024_WaveletATTN.txt:149`)
- Scale invariance testing via scaled sequence variants. (`Notes/Vision/pdfs-3/2024_WaveletATTN.txt:148`)
- Frame completeness testing via inverse wavelet reconstruction error. (`Notes/Vision/pdfs-3/2024_WaveletATTN.txt:168`)

Number of trained model instances required to cover all tasks: 1
- All tasks are analyses applied to pre-trained Transformer models; no task-specific heads or fine-tuning are described for different tasks, so a single trained model instance can be analyzed with all methods. (`Notes/Vision/pdfs-3/2024_WaveletATTN.txt:190`, `Notes/Vision/pdfs-3/2024_WaveletATTN.txt:198`)

\boxed{
\frac{5\ \text{tasks}}{1\ \text{model}} = 5
