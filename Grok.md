# 4 Dimension Attention: Structural Embeddings for Native Space-Time Intelligence

## Abstract

Transformers have revolutionized sequential data processing but struggle with inherently multidimensional data like video, images, and graphs due to their linear sequence assumption. We propose *MonSTER* (Minkowski Space-Time Embedding Rotors), a novel positional encoding scheme that extends Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) to four-dimensional spacetime using the Clifford algebra Cl(1,3) with a Minkowski metric. Unlike traditional methods that flatten multidimensional data, MonSTER naturally encodes spatial and temporal relationships, capturing scale, direction, and temporal ordering ("before vs. after") through Lorentz transformations. We contrast MonSTER with existing schemes like RoPE, sinusoidal embeddings, and NeRF-style encodings, highlighting its ability to preserve geometric structure. While compute overhead increases due to 4x4 matrix operations per attention block, MonSTER enables transformers to process multimodal data—spanning vision, language, and graphs—natively in spacetime. We outline an ablation study to compare MonSTER against multidimensional RoPE and NeRF-inspired patch encodings, with applications in tasks like ARC-AGI.

## 01 Introduction

Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) excel in sequential tasks but falter in domains requiring spatial and temporal reasoning, such as the ARC-AGI benchmark (Chollet, 2019). This stems from their architectural bias: data is flattened into one-dimensional sequences, discarding critical geometric and relational information (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). Existing positional encodings—learned absolute embeddings, sinusoidal embeddings (Vaswani et al., 2017), and even Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021)—are designed for unidimensional sequences, limiting their ability to model spacetime natively.

We introduce *MonSTER* (Minkowski Space-Time Embedding Rotors), a positional encoding scheme that extends RoPE to four-dimensional spacetime using the Clifford algebra Cl(1,3) and a Minkowski metric. MonSTER encodes relative positions as Lorentz transformations, preserving the intrinsic structure of spacetime across media types (video, images, text, ASTs). By leveraging rotors in Cl(1,3), MonSTER naturally captures scale, direction, and temporal ordering, enabling transformers to reason about multidimensional data without flattening. We contrast MonSTER with existing methods, provide a theoretical foundation rooted in geometric algebra, and outline an ablation study to evaluate its effectiveness.

## 02 Related Work

### Positional Encodings in Transformers
- **Learned Absolute Embeddings** (Vaswani et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2020): These assign a fixed vector to each position, lacking flexibility for varying sequence lengths and failing to capture relative relationships. They are incompatible with efficient transformers like Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020).
- **Sinusoidal Embeddings** (Vaswani et al., 2017): These apply independent sine and cosine functions per coordinate, missing inter-coordinate relationships and lacking a geometric interpretation for relative positions.
- **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)** (Su et al., 2021): RoPE encodes relative positions via rotations in $\mathbb{C}^{d/2}$, preserving relative distances in attention scores. While extensible to multiple dimensions, its Euclidean basis limits its ability to model spacetime’s non-Euclidean geometry.
- **NeRF-Style Encodings** (Mildenhall et al., 2020): NeRF uses high-frequency Fourier features to encode spatial coordinates, often applied to image patches. This approach captures spatial relationships but lacks temporal structure and struggles with long-range dependencies in transformers.

### Geometric Algebra in Machine Learning
Clifford algebras have been explored in vision and robotics (Bayro-Corrochano, 2001) but are underutilized in transformers. Minkowski spacetime, used in physics for relativity, provides a natural framework for spacetime embeddings (Minkowski, 1908). Quaternions (Hamilton, 1843) and their extensions (biquaternions) have been used for 3D rotations (Clifford, 1873), but they lack the full structure of Cl(1,3) for spacetime.

## 03 Method

### Background: From Quaternions to Clifford Algebra

#### Evolution from Hamilton’s Quaternions
William Rowan Hamilton introduced quaternions in 1843 as an extension of complex numbers, defining $q = a + bi + cj + dk$ with $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$. Quaternions excel at representing 3D rotations via $q v q^{-1}$, where $v$ is a pure vector quaternion. However, quaternions are limited to Euclidean 3D space and cannot model time or non-Euclidean metrics.

William Clifford (1873) generalized quaternions into geometric algebras, where Cl(3,0) corresponds to 3D Euclidean space (isomorphic to quaternions for rotations). For spacetime, we use Cl(1,3), with a basis $\{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3\}$ and metric signature $(+, -, -, -)$: $e_0^2 = 1$, $e_1^2 = e_2^2 = e_3^2 = -1$, $e_i e_j = -e_j e_i$ for $i \neq j$. This algebra includes scalars, vectors, bivectors, trivectors, and a pseudoscalar, enabling a unified representation of rotations and boosts.

#### Minkowski vs. Euclidean Metrics
In Euclidean space, the metric is $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$, treating all dimensions equally. Minkowski spacetime, introduced by Hermann Minkowski in 1908, uses $ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2$, reflecting the causal structure of spacetime. The Minkowski metric ensures that temporal and spatial components interact asymmetrically, critical for modeling "before vs. after" relationships.

#### Rotors vs. Quaternions/Biquaternions
Quaternions handle 3D rotations but cannot represent Lorentz boosts. Biquaternions (complex quaternions) attempt to model spacetime but lack the geometric clarity of Cl(1,3). In Cl(1,3), a rotor $R = e^{\phi B/2}$, where $B$ is a bivector (e.g., $e_0 e_1$ for a boost, $e_1 e_2$ for a rotation), applies transformations via $v \mapsto R v R^{-1}$. This unifies rotations and boosts, preserving the Minkowski metric and enabling spacetime-aware embeddings.

### MonSTER: Minkowski Space-Time Embedding Rotors

#### Intuition
MonSTER extends RoPE’s rotation-based encoding to four-dimensional spacetime. RoPE applies 2D rotations in $\mathbb{C}^{d/2}$, preserving relative positions via $e^{i(m-n)\theta}$. MonSTER uses Cl(1,3) rotors to apply Lorentz transformations, encoding relative spacetime displacements $\Delta P = (\Delta t, \Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z)$ as a combination of spatial rotations and temporal boosts. This ensures attention scores depend on relative spacetime distances, capturing scale, direction, and causality.

#### Derivation
For query $q$ at position $P_q = (t_q, x_q, y_q, z_q)$ and key $k$ at $P_k = (t_k, x_k, y_k, z_k)$, compute the displacement $\Delta P = P_k - P_q$. Per block $b$, scale $\Delta P$ using inverse frequencies $\text{inv_freq}_b$ to capture multiscale relationships:

\[
\Delta t_{\text{scaled},b} = \Delta t \cdot \text{inv_freq}_{\text{time},b}, \quad \Delta s_{\text{scaled},b} = (\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z) \cdot \text{inv_freq}_{\text{space},b}
\]

- **Spatial Rotation**: Compute the rotation angle $\theta_b = \|\Delta s_{\text{scaled},b}\|_2$ and axis $u_{\text{rot},b} = \Delta s_{\text{scaled},b} / \theta_b$. Using Rodrigues’ formula, construct a 3x3 rotation matrix $M_{\text{rot},b}$, extended to 4x4 with $M_{\text{rot},b}[0,0] = 1$.
- **Temporal Boost**: Compute the rapidity $\phi_b = C_t \tanh(\Delta t_{\text{scaled},b} / C_t)$, ensuring stability. Construct a 4x4 boost matrix $M_{\text{boost},b}$ using $\cosh(\phi_b)$, $\sinh(\phi_b)$, and axis $u_{\text{boost},b} = u_{\text{rot},b}$.
- **Combined Rotor**: $R_{\text{eff},b} = M_{\text{boost},b} M_{\text{rot},b}$, applied to feature blocks $Q_b, K_b$ in attention: $\sum_b Q_b^T \eta R_{\text{eff},b} K_b$, where $\eta = \text{diag}(1, -1, -1, -1)$ is the Minkowski metric.

#### Natural Emergence of Properties
- **Scale**: Multiscale frequencies allow MonSTER to capture both local and global spacetime relationships.
- **Direction**: The rotation axis $u_{\text{rot},b}$ encodes spatial directionality.
- **Before vs. After**: The Minkowski metric and boosts ensure $\Delta t$ influences attention asymmetrically, distinguishing past from future.

### Contrast with Existing Schemes
- **RoPE**: Limited to Euclidean rotations, RoPE cannot model spacetime’s causal structure. MonSTER’s Cl(1,3) rotors handle both rotations and boosts.
- **Sinusoidal Embeddings**: These lack inter-coordinate mixing and a geometric basis, failing to capture spacetime relationships.
- **NeRF-Style Encodings**: While effective for spatial data, NeRF encodings are static and lack temporal dynamics, unlike MonSTER’s spacetime-aware transformations.

## 04 Experiments

### Experimental Setup
We propose an ablation study to evaluate MonSTER against two baselines:
1. **MonSTER (Our Method)**: Uses Cl(1,3) rotors with Minkowski metric.
2. **Multidimensional RoPE**: Extends RoPE to four dimensions with independent Euclidean rotations per dimension pair (Su et al., 2021).
3. **NeRF-Inspired Encoding**: Encodes sequences as image patches with Fourier features (Mildenhall et al., 2020).

**Datasets**: ARC-AGI (visual reasoning), Multimodal Video (video understanding), and Abstract Syntax Trees (code analysis).  
**Metrics**: Task-specific accuracy, convergence speed, and perplexity (where applicable).

### Planned Comparisons
- **Global Attention**: Compare validation loss and convergence on ARC-AGI tasks.
- **Multimodal Tasks**: Evaluate performance on video frame prediction and AST generation.
- **Scalability**: Test with models from 125M to 1.4B parameters.

*Placeholder: We don’t yet have benchmarks, but results will be reported here.*

## 05 Discussion

### Compute and State-Size Trade-Offs
- **Compute Overhead**: MonSTER applies 4x4 Lorentz transformations per block, increasing compute over RoPE’s 2x2 rotations. For $B$ blocks and sequence length $N$, the cost scales as $O(B N^2)$, roughly 4x RoPE’s overhead. However, this is mitigated by block-diagonal sparsity.
- **State-Size**: MonSTER requires storing $R_{\text{eff},b}$ matrices ($B \times 4 \times 4$ floats), a modest increase over RoPE’s $B \times 2 \times 2$.
- **Implementation**: The JAX implementation leverages vectorized operations, but numerical stability (e.g., avoiding division by zero) requires careful tuning of $\epsilon$ and $C_t$.

### Applications in Multimodal Contexts
- **Vision (ARC-AGI)**: MonSTER enables transformers to reason about spatial transformations natively, improving performance on grid-based tasks.
- **Video Understanding**: Temporal boosts model causality, enhancing frame prediction and event sequencing.
- **Graphs and ASTs**: By treating nodes as spacetime events, MonSTER captures structural and temporal dependencies in code or networks.

## 06 Conclusion

MonSTER redefines positional encodings for transformers by embedding data in four-dimensional spacetime using Cl(1,3) rotors. It overcomes the limitations of linear sequence models, enabling native reasoning over multimodal data. While compute costs are higher, the geometric fidelity and flexibility of MonSTER open new avenues for transformer applications. Future work will include empirical validation and optimization of compute efficiency.
