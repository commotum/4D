A solved positional/coordinate interface would have most of these properties:

1. **Resolution extrapolation**: train at one size, run at many, no degradation cliff
2. **Transform consistency**: predictable behavior under crop/resize/rotate/time-resample
3. **Compositional geometry**: easy to express “part-of”, “same object”, “corresponds to”
4. **Cross-instance comparability**: align entities across images/videos without padding hell
5. **Efficiency**: doesn’t require quadratic attention over ever-growing token grids
6. **Plug-and-play**: works across classification/detection/segmentation/video/3D-ish tasks

If someone produced an encoding + minimal interface tweaks that reliably gave you these, people *would* call it canonical.
