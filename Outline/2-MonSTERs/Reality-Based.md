1. **Everything that exists has a spacetime address, so a 4D positional code is a universal representational substrate.**

2. **If you can encode *where-and-when* in 3+1 dimensions, you can in principle encode anything that can ever be observed.**

3. **Spacetime is the coordinate system of reality; a 4D positional encoding inherits its generality.**

4. **Any physical fact is an event in spacetime, so encoding 4D position is the shortest path to encoding the world.**

5. **To be task-agnostic across modalities, position must be defined in the one frame shared by all data: spacetime.**

6. **A universal positional prior should not count tokens—it should locate events in 3+1D.**

7. **Because all structure is grounded in relations between events, 4D coordinates provide a modality-independent scaffold for representation.**

8. **Four coordinates—time and three of space—are enough to situate every possible observation.**

9. **Reality is a set of spacetime-localized events; encode that localization and you can represent any reality-grounded task.**

10. **The most general positional encoding is the one the universe uses: a 3+1D coordinate.**

11. **When position lives in spacetime rather than a 1D index, “anything that exists” becomes a valid input.**

12. **If a model can represent 4D displacement, it can represent the relational geometry underlying every physical interaction.**

13. **A representation that can name an event’s (t, x, y, z) can, in principle, name any event.**

14. **Spacetime is the universal container for information; a 4D positional encoding is a universal container for positions.**

15. **To capture the full range of real-world structure, positional encoding must be spatiotemporal, not merely sequential.**

16. **All modalities ultimately describe *where and when* something happens, so a 4D positional code can unify them.**

17. **A truly general positional encoding treats inputs as points in spacetime, because that’s where everything that can happen must happen.**

18. **Since every phenomenon is embedded in 3+1 dimensions, a 4D position signal is the most expressive positional primitive we can choose.**

19. **Encoding 4D position is encoding the stage on which every task, object, and interaction is defined.**

20. **If your coordinates cover spacetime, your representations can cover existence.**
