### Abstract

- No dominant method for tasks beyond 1D / proliferation of variants
- In single-task settings, the encoding method is inconsequential

- Improvements to RoPE come in two flavors:
   - Extensions
   - Compromises
   
- Majority of researchers take the trade:
   - Abandon structural constraint
   - Implement task-specific improvement







While RoPE has become the dominant positional encoding method for 1D tasks, no equivalent 

The absence of a singular favored method for extending 


“The lack of a single, widely adopted scheme for extending positional encodings beyond 1D suggests that, in fixed domains, transformers can often internalize spatial structure without a canonical inductive bias—but that this brittleness shows up when we demand multitask, cross-domain generalization.”

“That the community has not converged on a RoPE-like standard for 2D/3D/4D positional encoding is a sign that many extensions work ‘well enough’ in narrow settings, yet fail to provide the shared, transferable structure needed for multitask learning.”

“The proliferation of incompatible 2D–4D RoPE variants and learned embeddings—without a clear winner—indicates that positional structure is frequently recoverable from task-specific data, but becomes a limiting factor once we move to general-purpose, multitask models.”

“The absence of consensus on higher-dimensional positional encodings points to a mismatch between what suffices for single-task training and what is required for robust, compositional transfer across tasks and modalities.”

“That no RoPE-equivalent has emerged for higher-dimensional inputs suggests that transformers can compensate for imperfect positional bias in constrained regimes, while revealing the need for a principled, shared encoding when scaling to multitask learners.”

The absence of a singular favored method for extending the positional encodings of transformer models to higher dimensions is an indicator that ....

Basically, I'm trying to say, when we extend to 2d, or to 3d, or to 4d, there's been many papers proposing modifications to RoPE, or using learned positional embeddings, but there hasn't been this consolidation around a single method like there has been for RoPE in 1D. I think it's because the transformer is so powerful, that if you only train on a single task, or if you fix the domain of the task, it can learn those relationships anyway. However, when you want to move onto multitask learners, there's where trouble arises. Do you see where I'm trying to go? Can you give me 5 options for that opening sentence?

Yes—**for the ViT image encoder in OpenAI’s CLIP, the patch tokens use a learned (trainable) absolute positional embedding**.

In the released OpenAI CLIP code, the VisionTransformer defines `self.positional_embedding` as an `nn.Parameter` with one embedding per patch position **plus one for the class token**, i.e. shape roughly `(grid_size^2 + 1, width)`. ([GitHub][1])

(Separately: CLIP’s **text** encoder also uses a learned absolute positional embedding with a fixed context length—commonly 77 tokens in the released models. ([GitHub][2]))

If you mean **GPT-2** (“Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners”), then the **zero-shot** part is supportable; the **“aligning positional representations with reality’s dimensionality causes it”** part is *your interpretation* and should be framed that way.

### What GPT-2 actually supports (safe to state as fact)

* GPT-2 is trained with a **left-to-right language modeling objective** (next-token prediction).
* The paper reports **zero-shot (and task-structured) performance** on several NLP benchmarks, with stronger results on some tasks (e.g., reading comprehension) and weaker/rudimentary performance on others (e.g., summarization). ([OpenAI CDN][1])

So a “bullet-proof” sentence can anchor on those claims.

### What to avoid (or soften)

> “Next token prediction is only possible in the 1D temporal domain.”

That’s too absolute. Autoregressive prediction only requires **an ordering**; many domains can be linearized (images as raster scans, audio frames, 3D voxels, etc.). What *is* defensible is: language has a **natural sequential order**, and the autoregressive factorization matches that structure.

### A sturdier way to say your “geometry alignment” point

Use **interpretive language** and define what you mean by “geometry”:

**Option A (tight + academic):**

> Radford et al. show that a large transformer trained with next-token prediction can exhibit meaningful zero-shot behavior on a range of NLP tasks. ([OpenAI CDN][1]) One way to interpret this is that language provides a *native 1D ordering*, and the autoregressive objective exploits that inductive bias particularly well.

**Option B (more explicit about the conjecture):**

> GPT-2 demonstrates that next-token pretraining can yield nontrivial zero-shot transfer on several benchmarks. ([OpenAI CDN][1]) We hypothesize that part of what makes this work is structural: text is inherently sequential, so the model’s positional scheme and training objective are aligned with a natural 1D structure of the data.

**Option C (if you want to lean into “geometry” without overclaiming):**

> GPT-2 provides evidence that scaling next-token pretraining yields emergent zero-shot capabilities in language. ([OpenAI CDN][1]) We propose a geometric reading: when the learning problem is posed in a coordinate system that matches the data’s intrinsic structure (for text, a 1D sequence), generalization becomes easier; the spatiotemporal case may demand encodings that are native to 4D structure.

### If you want it truly “bullet-proof”

Make a clean separation between **(1) cited empirical claim** and **(2) your hypothesis**:

> **Empirically**, GPT-2 shows nontrivial zero-shot performance on multiple NLP tasks under a next-token training objective. ([OpenAI CDN][1]) **We conjecture** that this success is helped by the fact that language comes with a natural 1D ordering, so the model’s positional/causal structure matches the data’s dominant organization.

If you paste the next 2–3 sentences after your abstract’s opening, I can rewrite the whole paragraph so the factual claims are tightly attributed and the conjecture reads intentional rather than like a shaky citation.

One of the highest-leverage actions in engineering is removing steps, constraints, or components entirely. 




The absence of a canonical positional encoding in vision is a strong signal that the transformer interface is doing unnecessary work to emulate spatial structure it does not natively support.


1. **Everything that exists has a spacetime address, so a 4D positional code is a universal representational substrate.**

2. **If you can encode *where-and-when* in 3+1 dimensions, you can in principle encode anything that can ever be observed.**

3. **Spacetime is the coordinate system of reality; a 4D positional encoding inherits its generality.**

4. **Any physical fact is an event in spacetime, so encoding 4D position is the shortest path to encoding the world.**

5. **To be task-agnostic across modalities, position must be defined in the one frame shared by all data: spacetime.**

6. **A universal positional prior should not count tokens—it should locate events in 3+1D.**

7. **Because all structure is grounded in relations between events, 4D coordinates provide a modality-independent scaffold for representation.**

8. **Four coordinates—time and three of space—are enough to situate every possible observation.**

9. **Reality is a set of spacetime-localized events; encode that localization and you can represent any reality-grounded task.**

10. **The most general positional encoding is the one the universe uses: a 3+1D coordinate.**

11. **When position lives in spacetime rather than a 1D index, “anything that exists” becomes a valid input.**

12. **If a model can represent 4D displacement, it can represent the relational geometry underlying every physical interaction.**

13. **A representation that can name an event’s (t, x, y, z) can, in principle, name any event.**

14. **Spacetime is the universal container for information; a 4D positional encoding is a universal container for positions.**

15. **To capture the full range of real-world structure, positional encoding must be spatiotemporal, not merely sequential.**

16. **All modalities ultimately describe *where and when* something happens, so a 4D positional code can unify them.**

17. **A truly general positional encoding treats inputs as points in spacetime, because that’s where everything that can happen must happen.**

18. **Since every phenomenon is embedded in 3+1 dimensions, a 4D position signal is the most expressive positional primitive we can choose.**

19. **Encoding 4D position is encoding the stage on which every task, object, and interaction is defined.**

20. **If your coordinates cover spacetime, your representations can cover existence.**





By adopting the standard transformer architecture, researchers implicitly commit to a fixed-index, fixed-context positional scheme. For single-task vision models—such as classification, detection, or image generation—this restriction is largely inconsequential, as the task structure, dimensionality, and invariances are known in advance and can be amortized over scale.

However, for unrestrained multi-task spatiotemporal learning, this architectural commitment becomes a dominant constraint. Expressing variable-dimensional structure, dynamic grouping, and cross-instance comparison within a fixed positional index requires increasingly long contexts, heavy padding, and complex attention approximations, driving up computational cost and model size.

In this regime, positional encoding is not the primary limitation but a proxy for a deeper architectural friction: the effort required to simulate flexible spatiotemporal structure within a fixed-index sequence model. The absence of a canonical positional encoding in vision is therefore best understood not as an unresolved encoding choice, but as evidence that the standard transformer interface imposes an unnecessary burden on unrestrained spatial reasoning.

---

**Short answer:** I mostly agree with the thrust of the argument, with one important qualification about *where* the constraint actually bites and *why* transformers have remained competitive despite it.

---

### Where I agree

Your core claim—that standard transformers *implicitly commit to a fixed-index, fixed-context interface*—is accurate and often underappreciated.

1. **Fixed-index sequence as an architectural commitment**
   Even with learned, relative, rotary, or implicit positional encodings, the transformer’s interface is still:

   * a flat sequence
   * with a fixed maximum length
   * addressed by index-based attention

   Positional encoding choices only modulate *how* indices are interpreted; they do not remove the fact that the model must *simulate* structure rather than *represent* it natively.

2. **Vision succeeds because structure can be amortized**
   In single-task vision settings (classification, detection, generation):

   * spatial dimensionality is fixed
   * invariances are known (translation, locality, scale)
   * the task distribution is narrow

   Under these conditions, the cost of flattening space into tokens is largely paid once, at scale. Patch embeddings + attention work because the model never has to *re-negotiate* the meaning of space.

3. **Unrestrained spatiotemporal learning breaks the illusion**
   As soon as you introduce:

   * variable numbers of entities
   * dynamic grouping and regrouping
   * cross-instance comparison
   * evolving spatial frames or reference systems

   the transformer is forced into:

   * longer contexts
   * padding and masking
   * quadratic or approximate attention
   * ad hoc routing mechanisms

   All of this is *simulation overhead*—not learning difficulty per se, but architectural friction.

4. **Positional encoding as a proxy problem**
   I strongly agree with your reframing:

   > positional encoding is not the primary limitation but a proxy

   The persistent lack of a “canonical” positional encoding in vision is a symptom of the deeper mismatch between:

   * flexible spatial reasoning
   * and a fixed-index sequence abstraction

   If the interface were right, positional encoding would be boring.

---

### Where I would qualify the argument

The one place I’d soften the claim is the implication that this makes the standard transformer *fundamentally unsuitable* rather than *strategically overused*.

1. **Transformers are interface-stable, not structure-optimal**
   The reason transformers dominate is not that they are ideal, but that they provide:

   * a uniform interface
   * massive tooling and hardware support
   * composability across modalities

   Researchers tolerate architectural friction because the ecosystem payoff is enormous.

2. **The model can internalize structure—but inefficiently**
   Large transformers *do* learn latent spatial graphs, object files, and temporal abstractions—but only by:

   * burning parameters
   * expanding context
   * relying on scale to smooth over mismatch

   This is why performance continues to improve, but cost curves look ugly.

3. **The real constraint is not position, but addressability**
   I’d sharpen your thesis slightly:

   > The bottleneck is not position, but **how computation is addressed**.

   Transformers can only attend by index.
   What unrestrained spatiotemporal reasoning wants is:

   * object-addressable memory
   * dynamic relational binding
   * variable-arity interaction

   Position just happens to be where the mismatch becomes visible first.

---

### A concise reframing

If I were to compress your argument into a single line I agree with:

> The absence of a canonical positional encoding in vision is not an open problem to be solved, but a signal that the sequence-based transformer interface is doing unnecessary work to emulate spatial structure it does not natively support.

That’s a strong and, in my view, correct diagnosis.

---

### Bottom line

* ✅ You’re right that positional encoding debates often miss the deeper issue
* ✅ You’re right that fixed-index sequence models impose hidden costs on flexible spatial reasoning
* ⚠️ The transformer’s persistence is less about correctness and more about ecosystem gravity

If you’re heading toward architectures that treat *structure as first-class* rather than *emergent from attention*, your argument is already standing on solid ground.

---

If it *is* an open problem, I’d restate it like this:

> **Find a positional (or more generally, coordinate) interface that lets a model generalize across vision tasks and spatiotemporal regimes with minimal architectural hacks, minimal context growth, and stable inductive biases.**

That’s genuinely open—*not* because we lack clever encodings, but because we don’t yet have a universally satisfying **contract** between geometry and computation.

Here are the strongest “it’s open” arguments, plus what a real solution would have to look like.

---

## Why it can still be an open problem

### 1) “Canonical” might mean *task- and scale-invariant*

For language, discrete order gives you a natural default. For vision, a good default would need to behave well across:

* resolutions and aspect ratios
* crops/augmentations
* multi-view or multi-camera geometry
* video frame rates / variable sampling
* dense prediction and sparse object reasoning
* 2D ↔ 3D transitions (images to world)

A positional scheme that is *truly canonical* would make those transformations “cheap” for the model.

### 2) The issue might be *representation*, not *architecture*

Even within a fixed-index transformer, the *right* positional representation could:

* reduce the need for long contexts by enabling better factorization
* make grouping/relations easier to express (e.g., via relative geometry)
* provide better extrapolation to unseen sizes and shapes
* stabilize attention patterns across scales

So yes: it’s plausible that we haven’t yet found the encoding that makes the sequence interface “good enough” for most spatiotemporal reasoning.

### 3) Vision’s “no canonical encoding” might reflect *missing priors*

Vision has multiple plausible geometric priors, and none fully dominates:

* translation equivariance (CNN-like)
* scale-space structure
* perspective/projective geometry
* object-centric coordinates
* scene-centric / world coordinates
* temporal coherence

If the right answer is a *blend*, the open problem is: **how do we combine them without brittle heuristics?**

---

## What would count as “solving” it?

A solved positional/coordinate interface would have most of these properties:

1. **Resolution extrapolation**: train at one size, run at many, no degradation cliff
2. **Transform consistency**: predictable behavior under crop/resize/rotate/time-resample
3. **Compositional geometry**: easy to express “part-of”, “same object”, “corresponds to”
4. **Cross-instance comparability**: align entities across images/videos without padding hell
5. **Efficiency**: doesn’t require quadratic attention over ever-growing token grids
6. **Plug-and-play**: works across classification/detection/segmentation/video/3D-ish tasks

If someone produced an encoding + minimal interface tweaks that reliably gave you these, people *would* call it canonical.

---

## Two ways the “open problem” could resolve

### A) A *better positional encoding* within the transformer

This would mean an encoding that effectively gives you:

* robust relative geometry
* multi-scale coherence
* maybe some notion of “frame” or “chart” selection

…without requiring the model to learn all of that from scratch.

### B) A *better interface* that makes “position” less central

If the breakthrough is actually an interface change (object-addressable tokens, dynamic sparsity, hierarchical routing, etc.), then “positional encoding” becomes canonical almost automatically—because the *units of computation* are no longer tied to a rigid grid.

In that world, the open problem wasn’t “encoding,” but encoding was the visible tip of it.

---

## Reconciling your original claim with “it’s open”

Both can be true depending on definitions:

* If “canonical positional encoding” means **a single best way to inject coordinates into a flat token sequence**, then it may indeed be a proxy for deeper friction.
* If it means **a stable geometric contract that enables broad generalization and efficiency**, then yes—it’s plausibly an open problem, and a valuable one.

So the sharpest version is:

> The open problem is not “which sinusoid,” but “what geometric *contract* should the model’s computational primitives obey?”

---

If you want, I can propose a concrete taxonomy of what “canonical” could mean (equivariance-based, correspondence-based, world-geometry-based, object-centric, etc.) and what empirical tests would actually distinguish “solved” from “merely competitive.”

Great — then we’re fully aligned, and it’s worth being very precise about what that implies.

If the goal is **a stable geometric contract that enables broad generalization and efficiency**, then the positional-encoding debate stops being about *signals* and becomes about *interfaces*. Below is a clean way to frame the problem, why it remains open, and what would actually count as progress.

---

## What “geometric contract” really means

A **geometric contract** is an agreement between:

* the *world* (space, time, objects, viewpoints), and
* the *model* (tokens, attention, memory, computation),

such that **geometric transformations in the world induce predictable, low-cost transformations in computation**.

Language has this:

* reordering → attention shifts
* syntax → locality patterns
* discourse → long-range attention

Vision does not—yet.

---

## Why vision lacks a stable contract

Vision violates three assumptions implicit in the transformer interface:

### 1) **Multiplicity of reference frames**

Vision simultaneously cares about:

* image coordinates
* object-local coordinates
* camera/view coordinates
* scene/world coordinates
* temporal coordinates

A flat positional encoding must choose one *privileged* frame. Any choice is wrong some of the time.

### 2) **Variable cardinality and granularity**

Objects appear, disappear, merge, split, and recur.
Tokens want to represent:

* pixels
* patches
* objects
* parts
* trajectories

A fixed tokenization + index scheme can’t change granularity without re-encoding the entire scene.

### 3) **Relational meaning dominates absolute location**

For most vision reasoning:

* “left of”, “same object as”, “corresponds to in next frame”
  matter more than
* “token index 1532”

A contract built around absolute indices forces the model to *derive* relations indirectly.

---

## Why positional encoding became the focal point

Positional encoding is where the contract *leaks*.

Researchers keep asking:

* absolute vs relative?
* sinusoidal vs learned?
* rotary vs ALiBi?
* 2D vs 3D vs separable?

Because none of these choices:

* eliminate padding and masking
* reduce quadratic blowups
* stabilize cross-resolution generalization
* make correspondence cheap

That’s the telltale sign of a missing contract.

---

## What a real solution would guarantee

A solved geometric contract would make the following *invariant or cheap*:

### Spatial guarantees

* Translation, scaling, cropping → predictable token transformations
* Resolution changes → no re-learning
* Multi-view alignment → shared latent geometry

### Temporal guarantees

* Variable frame rate → stable trajectories
* Long-range correspondence → sparse, persistent links
* Occlusion/reappearance → recoverable identity

### Computational guarantees

* Cost grows with *entities*, not *pixels*
* Attention is mostly sparse by default
* Grouping does not require re-encoding context

---

## What this implies about architecture

Here’s the key insight:

> **A geometric contract cannot be bolted onto a sequence model—it has to be partially enforced by the computational substrate.**

That doesn’t mean “throw away transformers,” but it does mean:

* Tokens must be *addressable by relation*, not just index
* Geometry must modulate *routing*, not just embeddings
* Grouping must be explicit or cheaply emergent
* Memory must persist across time and scale

In other words: **position becomes a property of interaction, not annotation**.

---

## Why this remains genuinely open

Despite many partial successes:

* CNN equivariance is too rigid
* Vision Transformers are too flat
* Graph models lack scale and efficiency
* Object-centric models struggle with realism
* 3D/world models require supervision or sensors

No existing approach satisfies:

> *flexible geometry × task generality × computational efficiency*

at once.

That’s the open problem.

---

## A precise restatement (you could publish this)

> The lack of a canonical positional encoding in vision reflects the absence of a stable geometric contract between perceptual structure and computation. The open problem is not how to encode position in tokens, but how to define computational primitives whose interactions respect spatial and temporal structure while remaining task-agnostic, efficient, and compositional.

That’s a clean, defensible, and important framing.

---

If you want to push this further, the natural next steps are:

* formalizing *what invariances must be cheap*
* identifying *which geometry should be explicit vs learned*
* designing *benchmarks that break flat token models*

I’m happy to help with any of those directions.


Good question — this is a subtle point, and it’s easy to overstate it if we’re not careful. Let me unpack exactly what I mean, and also where the analogy *breaks*.

---

## What it means for language to “have a contract”

When I say *language has a geometric (or structural) contract*, I don’t mean it’s perfect or innate. I mean that **the transformer’s native computation aligns unusually well with the structure of language**, so that *structure maps cleanly onto attention behavior* without architectural strain.

The three bullets are shorthand for that alignment.

---

## 1) Reordering → attention shifts

In language:

* Meaning is largely invariant to *where* words occur in absolute index
* What matters is **relative order and dependency**

If you paraphrase a sentence or move a clause:

* token identities stay the same
* relative relations change in small, local ways
* attention redistributes accordingly

Crucially:

* the sequence order *is* the linguistic axis
* “next token” is a meaningful primitive
* attention shifting is exactly what’s needed

So when you reorder language, you’re not fighting the interface — you’re using it.

---

## 2) Syntax → locality patterns

Syntax induces **mostly local dependencies**:

* determiners ↔ nouns
* adjectives ↔ nouns
* auxiliaries ↔ verbs

Transformers naturally express this as:

* high attention weight to nearby tokens
* occasional long jumps for movement or agreement

This matches the model’s bias:

* quadratic attention is affordable
* locality emerges without enforcement
* syntax trees are *implicit*, not simulated via padding or hacks

The sequence is already the right topology.

---

## 3) Discourse → long-range attention

Discourse phenomena (coreference, topic continuity, causal chains):

* are sparse
* occur at low frequency
* but require long-range links

Transformers handle this well:

* most attention is local
* a few heads specialize in long-range jumps
* cost grows, but meaningfully

Again, the *rare but important* long-range edges fit the attention pattern.

---

## Why vision does **not** have this (yet)

Now contrast with vision.

### Reordering in vision ≠ meaning-preserving

If you reorder image patches:

* you destroy spatial adjacency
* attention must *reconstruct* geometry
* invariance is not free

There is no canonical “next patch” primitive.

---

### Locality is ambiguous

Vision locality depends on:

* scale
* object boundaries
* depth
* motion

Two nearby pixels might be unrelated.
Two distant pixels might be the same object.

So “local attention” is often *wrong*, and “global attention” is too expensive.

---

### Long-range structure is dominant, not exceptional

In vision:

* object identity
* correspondence across frames
* part–whole relations

are **core**, not rare.

But attention treats them as expensive special cases.

---

## The deeper point

Language structure aligns with:

* a 1D sequence
* relative order
* sparse long-range links

Vision structure aligns with:

* multi-frame geometry
* dynamic grouping
* reference-frame shifts
* entity persistence

Trying to express vision through a language-shaped interface causes friction.

So when I say *language has this*, I mean:

> The transformer’s default computational primitives already match the dominant structural operations of language, whereas they only weakly and indirectly match those of vision.

That’s why:

* positional encoding in language is boring and settled
* positional encoding in vision is endlessly debated

## Where the analogy breaks (important)

This does **not** mean:

* language is solved
* transformers are optimal
* discourse/world modeling is easy

It means only that:

* the **index-based attention interface is closer to the natural structure of language than to that of vision**

That’s a contingent fact, not a theoretical guarantee.

## One-sentence distillation

> Language “has a geometric contract” in the sense that rearranging linguistic structure induces small, predictable changes in attention patterns, whereas rearranging visual structure often forces the model to reconstruct geometry from scratch.

If you want, we can go further and formalize this in terms of **topology alignment**, **graph sparsity**, or **information locality** — this is exactly where the argument becomes very sharp.
