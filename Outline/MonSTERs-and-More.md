# MonSTER Models are Domain-Agnostic Multitask Learners

---












That’s a really good instinct to question, because **“canonical” is doing a lot of hidden work** in this discussion.

Short answer: **“canonical” is defensible, but only if you’re explicit about what axis it’s canonical along.** Otherwise it invites confusion or pushback.

Let’s unpack it carefully.

---

## What “canonical” usually means (and why it’s slippery)

In technical contexts, *canonical* typically means one or more of:

1. **Privileged / standard**  
	A representation that everyone agrees to use by default.
2. **Invariant under equivalence**  
	Different surface forms map to the same underlying representation.
3. **Minimal / irreducible**  
	Removes arbitrary degrees of freedom.
4. **Naturally induced**  
	Arises from the structure of the problem itself, not an arbitrary choice.

In math, these often coincide.  
In ML, they often don’t.

So when people hear *“canonical positional encoding”*, they may think:

- “the one true encoding”
- “the optimal formula”
- “the standard everyone should adopt”

Which is **not** what you mean.

---

## What you mean by canonical (made explicit)

From everything you’ve said, *canonical* means:

> **A stable, task-agnostic geometric contract that makes the common transformations of vision cheap and predictable for computation.**

That’s much closer to sense (2) + (4) above than sense (1).

In other words:

- not *unique*
- not *perfect*
- but **structurally natural**

---

## Why “canonical” still kind of works

It works *if* you’re careful, because:

- Language has a canonical coordinate: **token order**
- Time series have a canonical coordinate: **time**
- Graphs often have a canonical structure: **adjacency**

Vision *does not*, and that absence is exactly the point you’re making.

So saying:

> “vision lacks a canonical positional encoding”

can be read as:

> “vision lacks a natural, privileged geometric interface that the model can rely on across tasks and scales”

That’s defensible.

---

## Why it may still be the wrong word rhetorically

Even if it’s *conceptually* correct, “canonical” causes problems:

1. **People will argue about uniqueness**  
	“There can’t be one canonical encoding because vision is multi-scale / multi-frame / multi-view.”
2. **It sounds prescriptive**  
	As if you’re claiming there *should* be one.
3. **It centers encoding, not interaction**  
	Which subtly pulls attention away from your deeper point about computational contracts.

You’ll get debates about sinusoids instead of about structure.

---

## Better alternatives (depending on emphasis)

Here are some replacements, each with a slightly different flavor:

### If you want precision

- **“stable geometric contract”** ← this is the cleanest
- **“privileged coordinate system”**
- **“structurally natural representation”**

### If you want to keep the intuition

- **“default geometric interface”**
- **“task-agnostic spatial prior”**
- **“shared coordinate abstraction”**

### If you want to be provocative but careful

- **“vision lacks a native positional interface”**
- **“there is no geometry-native tokenization for vision”**

---

## A refined version of your earlier claim

Instead of:

> “The absence of a canonical positional encoding in vision…”

You might say:

> “The absence of a stable, task-agnostic geometric contract in vision…”

or, if you want to keep “canonical” but disambiguate:

> “The absence of a canonical *geometric interface* —rather than a specific encoding—…”

That preserves your meaning and heads off bad-faith objections.

---

## Bottom line

- **“Canonical” is not wrong**, but it’s underspecified
- Your idea is stronger than the word suggests
- If you care about clarity, *name the contract, not the encoding*

If you want, I can help you rewrite the original paragraph in a way that’s maximally robust to misinterpretation while keeping its bite.

Here’s a paper‑by‑paper breakdown, focusing only on what each one actually says (explicitly or very clearly implicitly) about weaknesses of **RoPE** or **axial / multi‑D RoPE**.

---

## 1\. ComRoPE – Scalable and Robust Rotary Position Embedding Parameterized by Trainable Commuting Angle Matrices

ComRoPE is explicitly framed as fixing several deficiencies of existing RoPE variants:

**For RoPE in general**

- **Restricted expressiveness from 2D rotation groups.**  
	Existing RoPE formulations build their rotation matrices from 2D rotation groups. This simplifies computation but “restrict\[s\] their feature projection capabilities, especially in high‑dimensional spaces,” so the rotations can’t fully exploit the representation space.
- **Hand‑designed, non‑learnable rotation matrices.**  
	Most RoPE variants require manually designed rotation matrices / frequency schedules, which the authors argue leads to “insufficient capability and suboptimal performance.”
- **Some generalized RoPEs break the core relative‑position property.**  
	They point out that methods like LieRE use general trainable skew‑symmetric matrices but don’t ensure those matrices commute, so in practice  
	$R(x_q; A)^{\top}R(x_k; A) \neq R(x_q - x_k; A)$ ,  
	meaning attention scores can depend on absolute coordinates rather than only the offset. That violates the defining “RoPE equation” and harms positional robustness.

**For 2D / axial RoPE**

- **Diagonal‑direction blind spot in 2D axial RoPE.**  
	When summarizing prior 2D RoPE work (EVA‑02, FiT), they state that 2D RoPE “with axial frequencies (2D Axial RoPE)… had limitations in processing in the diagonal direction,” motivating RoPE‑ViT’s mixed‑frequency design.

So, from ComRoPE’s perspective, standard RoPE is (a) under‑expressive because of fixed 2D rotations, (b) too manually designed, and (c) sometimes incorrectly generalized so that the relative‑offset property breaks; axial 2D RoPE in particular can’t represent diagonals well.

---

## 2\. Rotary Position Embedding for Vision Transformer (RoPE‑ViT)

This is the main paper that really nails down a specific flaw of **axial 2D RoPE**:

- **Axial 2D RoPE cannot represent diagonal directions.**  
	The “axial frequency” extension splits dimensions into x‑axis and y‑axis halves and applies one‑dimensional RoPE independently per axis. The paper explicitly says this:
	- Axial frequency “is unable to handle diagonal directions since the frequencies only depend on a single axis.”
	- Relative positions become purely axial terms $e^{i\theta_t (p^x_n - p^x_m)}$ or $e^{i\theta_t (p^y_n - p^y_m)}$ and “cannot be converted to mixed frequency” that combines x and y.
	- Because RoPE already uses the query–key multiplication to implement relative offsets, there is “no way to mix axial frequencies for diagonal direction.”
	- They “conjecture that it might degrade RoPE’s potential performance and make sub‑optimal axial frequency choices in the vision domain.”
- **Empirical weakness of axial RoPE compared to mixed RoPE.**  
	Across ViT and Swin variants, RoPE‑Axial is consistently weaker than RoPE‑Mixed, especially in interpolation regimes and some extreme extrapolation resolutions.

So RoPE‑ViT’s core critique is that **separable axial RoPE structurally cannot encode diagonal/mixed spatial relationships**.

---

## 3\. Head-wise Adaptive Rotary Positional Encoding for Fine-Grained Image Generation (HARoPE)

HARoPE focuses on **multi‑dimensional RoPE** (including axial constructions) and is very explicit about the shortcomings it’s tackling.

They identify both *task‑level* and *architectural* limitations:

**Task-level issues observed with standard multi‑D RoPE**

- When applied to image generation, RoPE shows “significant limitations such as fine‑grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting,” i.e., trouble with fine spatial structure and compositionality.

**Three structural limitations of naïve multi‑dimensional RoPE (i.e., axial‑style RoPE)**

Section 3.2 lists three core problems:

1. **Rigid frequency allocation.**
	- Features are split evenly across axes; each axis reuses the same fixed spectrum $\theta_i = \theta_{\text{base}}^{-2i/d}$ with a manually chosen $\theta_{\text{base}}$ .
	- This assumes equal complexity and scale along all directions, which they say is “often violated” (e.g., spatial vs temporal axes), leading to suboptimal capacity and frequency coverage.
2. **Semantic misalignment & axis‑wise independence.**
	- Rotations act on fixed coordinate-indexed planes $(q_0, q_1), (q_2, q_3), \dots$ regardless of what semantic subspaces the model actually learns.
	- The block‑diagonal structure enforces per-axis independence and “suppresses explicit cross-axis interactions (e.g., diagonal or rotational couplings).”
3. **Head-wise uniformity.**
	- Standard RoPE applies the same positional map to every attention head, despite evidence that heads specialize (local vs long‑range).
	- This “weakens multi-scale, head-specific positional sensitivity.”

Their conclusion rephrases this: standard multi‑D RoPE has **rigid axis‑wise partitioning, fixed rotation planes misaligned with semantics, and head‑wise uniformity**, which is why it struggles with complex image structure.

---

## 4\. YaRN – Efficient Context Window Extension of Large Language Models

YaRN is about extending context for LLMs that use RoPE. It points out both a general positional‑encoding issue and RoPE‑specific behaviors under scaling.

**General positional-encoding limitation (including RoPE)**

- **Cannot generalize far beyond training context.**  
	They state that a common limitation of positional encodings is “the inability to generalize past the context window seen during training,” and that methods including RoPE are **not able to generalize to sequences significantly longer than their pre‑trained length** without special tricks.

**RoPE under naive interpolation / scaling**

Most of YaRN’s analysis is about what goes wrong when you try to stretch RoPE:

- **Uniform scaling (“PI”) erases high‑frequency detail.**  
	Position Interpolation (PI) scales all RoPE positions linearly $m \mapsto m/s$ . They argue that “stretching the RoPE embeddings indiscriminately results in the loss of important high frequency details” needed to distinguish very similar, nearby tokens.
- **Compression of token distances harms local order.**  
	They note that scaling all frequencies (via scale $s$ or a base change $b'$ ) makes tokens “closer to each other” in dot‑product space, which “severely impairs a LLM’s ability to understand small and local relationships,” likely causing confusion about the order of nearby tokens.
- **PI’s theory does not capture RoPE–embedding interaction.**  
	They remark that PI “stretches all RoPE dimensions equally,” but the theoretical interpolation bound used in PI “is insufficient at predicting the complex dynamics between RoPE and the LLM’s internal embeddings.”

**Issues with “NTK-aware” RoPE scaling**

- “NTK‑aware” RoPE interpolation corrects some high‑frequency loss but:
	- It extrapolates some dimensions to “out‑of‑bound” values, making fine‑tuning worse than PI.
	- The nominal scale factor $s$ no longer matches the real effective context extension; in practice $s$ has to be set larger than the desired ratio.

So, in YaRN’s framing, **raw RoPE is bound to its trained context, and naive RoPE scaling/interpolation harms high‑frequency/local information and miscalibrates distances**, motivating more targeted, frequency‑aware schemes.

---

## 5\. LOOPE – Learnable Optimal Patch Order in Positional Embeddings for Vision Transformers

LOOPE is about ordering patches for positional embeddings, but it does comment on RoPE in the related‑work section:

- **RoPE preserves relative position but does not capture spatial hierarchy.**  
	They state: “RoPE introduces rotationally invariant encodings that effectively preserve relative positioning but fails to model spatial hierarchies for structured 2D reasoning.”
- More broadly, when talking about relative PEs (the family RoPE belongs to), they note trade‑offs like discarding absolute position information, added computational complexity, and limited directional sensitivity in other RPEs; but the only RoPE‑specific criticism is the absence of hierarchical, multi‑scale 2D structure.

So LOOPE’s core RoPE critique is: **good for relative positions; poor for hierarchical / multi‑scale spatial structure in images.**

---

## 6\. Maximizing the Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Learnable Scaling (MPVG)

This paper is about how **absolute** positional embeddings are injected and scaled in ViTs with GAP, not about RoPE.

- RoPE is mentioned only as a well‑known relative PE with desirable properties (flexible sequence length, decaying dependency, etc.), not as something they’re fixing.
- There are **no explicit weaknesses or shortcomings of RoPE or axial RoPE** discussed here.

So for your purposes: MPVG doesn’t really say anything negative about RoPE; it’s orthogonal.

---

## 7\. ConViT – Improving Vision Transformers with Soft Convolutional Inductive Biases

ConViT introduces GPSA (Gated Positional Self‑Attention) with convolution‑like **relative position kernels**, but:

- In the provided text, **RoPE or axial RoPE is never mentioned.** Their analysis concerns PSA/GPSA kernels, inductive bias, and convergence to convolutions, not rotary encodings.
- Any limitations they note (e.g., parameter count, competition between content and position terms in PSA) are about their own PSA formulation, not RoPE.

So: **ConViT does not identify any weaknesses of RoPE or axial RoPE**; it’s about a different class of relative positional bias.

---

### Quick mental summary

If you want the distilled picture of how these papers collectively view RoPE / axial RoPE:

- **1D RoPE (LLMs):**
	- Great relative-offset behavior and extrapolation *within* training range, but:
		- Doesn’t naturally generalize to much longer contexts.
		- Uniform scaling/interpolation of RoPE damages high‑frequency/local order info.
		- Rotation matrices are manually designed and theoretically under‑expressive.
- **2D / multi‑D (axial) RoPE:**
	- Simple axial extension is:
		- Blind to diagonal / mixed directions.
		- Built on rigid, manually chosen frequency splits across axes.
		- Block‑diagonal, limiting cross‑axis couplings and misaligning with learned semantics.
		- Shared across heads, ignoring head specialization.
		- Not designed to capture hierarchical spatial structure in 2D reasoning.

If you want, I can next help map these criticisms into concrete design constraints for your own RoPE / axial‑RoPE variant (e.g., how to bake in cross‑axis mixing, head‑wise specialization, and frequency‑aware scaling).

**Short answer:**  
**RoPE-Mixed** is the *mixed-frequency 2D rotary embedding* introduced in **Heo et al. (2024), *Rotary Position Embedding for Vision Transformer***.  
It is a 2D generalization of RoPE that **uses *learned* frequency pairs for both x- and y-axes simultaneously**, so each head applies rotations of the form:

$$
R(n) = e^{\,i(\theta_t^x p_x + \theta_t^y p_y)}
$$

rather than separating the axes as in standard **2D Axial RoPE**.

Below is the exact explanation with supporting evidence from the paper.

---

## What RoPE-Mixed actually is

In the *Rotary Position Embedding for Vision Transformer* paper:

### 1\. Axial 2D RoPE (the older method)

Axial 2D RoPE applies **independent 1D RoPE rotations** along x and y:

$$
R_x(x),\; R_y(y)
$$

with frequencies reused from 1D RoPE, just split across dimensions.

The paper explicitly states this construction **cannot encode diagonal directions**:

- axial frequency “ **is unable to handle diagonal directions since the frequencies only depend on a single axis**.”

and that axial RoPE relative phases:

- “ **cannot be converted to mixed frequency** ” of the form θₓ·Δx + θᵧ·Δy.

---

### 2\. RoPE-Mixed (the improved version)

RoPE-Mixed is the paper’s proposed solution:  
**Rotate with a *learned* linear combination of x and y coordinates.**

They define the 2D rotation as:

$$
\mathbf{R}(n,t) = e^{i(\theta_t^x p^x_n + \theta_t^y p^y_n)}
$$

This gives each channel its own **(θₓ, θᵧ)** pair. These are *learned parameters*.

Then the relative phase becomes:

$$
e^{\,i(\theta_t^x (p_x^n - p_x^m) + \theta_t^y (p_y^n - p_y^m))}
$$

This allows:

- diagonal directions
- arbitrary orientations
- richer 2D geometry
- head-specific learned frequency structure

They emphasize:

- RoPE-Mixed is a **generalization** of axial RoPE (recovering axial when θₓ or θᵧ = 0).
- It solves the diagonal-blindness problem.

---

### 3\. The paper contrasts RoPE-Mixed vs Axial RoPE experimentally

Across ViT-S/B/L and Swin-T/S/B:

- **RoPE-Mixed consistently outperforms RoPE-Axial** in both interpolation and extrapolation.  
	Example figures: multi-resolution curves on pages showing substantial margins at 320–512 resolution.

RoPE-Mixed is explicitly identified as the stronger model in:

- multi-resolution ImageNet
- object detection (DINO-ViTDet)
- ADE20k segmentation

---

## TL;DR definition

### RoPE-Mixed = 2D RoPE with learned mixed-axis frequencies

Instead of rotating by:

$$
e^{i\theta_x p_x}, \; e^{i\theta_y p_y}
$$

it rotates by:

$$
e^{\,i(\theta^x p_x + \theta^y p_y)}
$$

for every frequency channel.

This lets the model express **arbitrary 2D directions**, not only horizontal + vertical.

---

If you'd like, I can also produce:

- a table comparing Axial vs Mixed vs 1D RoPE
- a visual explanation of the rotation geometry
- a summary of how other papers (HARoPE, ComRoPE, YaRN, etc.) relate to RoPE-Mixed.

Good question — that line *is* pretty dense.

Here’s what that LOOPE sentence is getting at, unpacked.

---

## 1\. “RoPE preserves relative positioning”

RoPE is a **relative** positional encoding:

- The attention score between tokens at positions *i* and *j* depends only on *(i − j)* (their offset), not on their absolute coordinates.
- In 2D/image form, that means it nicely encodes things like:
	- “this patch is 1 step to the right of that one”
	- “this patch is 3 steps up and 2 steps left from that one”

So LOOPE is acknowledging that:

> RoPE does a good job at encoding **pairwise relative positions** (local geometry).

That’s what they mean by “effectively preserve relative positioning.”

---

## 2\. “Rotationally invariant encodings”

This is a bit of shorthand. In the RoPE-ViT / 2D RoPE context:

- The positional information is represented as **complex rotations** (or 2D rotation matrices) applied to feature pairs.
- Because these are rotations in a shared space, some *global* transformations (like uniform shifts and certain basis rotations) don’t change the *relative* structure.

So “rotationally invariant” here is basically:

> the *form* of the encoding is built out of rotations, and what matters for attention is the **relative phase difference**, not the absolute angle itself.

That ties back to the “relative, not absolute” idea.

---

## 3\. “Fails to model spatial hierarchies for structured 2D reasoning”

This is the key criticism.

By “spatial hierarchies,” they mean **multi-scale / structured information** like:

- grouping patches into **larger regions** (super-patches, objects, parts)
- understanding relationships like:
	- this patch is in the **top-left quadrant** of the image
	- this patch is part of the **same object** as some distant patch
	- coarse layout: “sky over ground over road”

RoPE, as normally used:

- gives every patch a position via a fixed-frequency rotational map.
- treats all positions at a single, flat scale (one fixed grid / frequency spectrum).
- is excellent at *pairwise offsets* but **doesn’t explicitly encode**:
	- levels of scale (patch → region → whole image)
	- tree-like, nested structure
	- “this is locally close but globally far” vs “globally close but locally far,” etc.

LOOPE’s point is:

> RoPE gives you **good local/mid-range relative geometry**, but no built-in notion of **coarse vs fine spatial structure** — i.e., no hierarchical organization of space.

That’s important for “structured 2D reasoning” tasks where you care about layout at multiple levels (like scene understanding, complex object relationships, etc.), not just pairwise distances.

---

## 4\. How this contrasts with what they care about

LOOPE is all about:

- the **1D ordering of patches** that you feed into sinusoidal / Fourier-style PEs, and
- how that ordering affects the model’s ability to preserve:
	- monotonicity
	- translation properties
	- multi-scale structure when you flatten a 2D grid.

So from their perspective:

- Classical sinusoidal APE + a good 1D patch order can **encode some hierarchical patterns** (via frequency structure + ordering).
- RoPE, being purely relative and flat in its usual form, **doesn’t directly give you those hierarchical constraints** — it just gives you offset-aware rotations.

That’s why they summarize RoPE as:

> “great for relative positions; not designed to encode hierarchical, multi-scale 2D structure.”

---

If you want, next step could be to connect this with HARoPE and ComRoPE, which *do* try to add more structure/flexibility on top of RoPE (e.g., head-wise adaptation, higher-dimensional rotation groups).

Let me split this into the three things you asked:

1. **Compare mixed RoPE vs MonSTERs – which is “stronger”?**
2. **Does mixed RoPE’s learned mixed frequencies actually fix the diagonal problem?**
3. **What mathematical proof (if any) do they give that they solved it?**

---

## 1\. Mixed RoPE vs MonSTERs – what’s actually different?

### Mixed RoPE (RoPE‑Mixed in the ViT paper)

For 2D positions $p = (p_x, p_y)$ , RoPE‑Mixed replaces axial 2D RoPE’s separate x/y angles with a **single mixed angle** per 2D block:

$$
R(n, t) = e^{i(\theta_t^x p_x + \theta_t^y p_y)}
$$
- Each frequency index $t$ has a **learnable pair** $(\theta_t^x, \theta_t^y)$ .
- The relative phase for a displacement $\Delta p = ( \Delta x, \Delta y )$ becomes:
$$
\phi_t(\Delta p) = \theta_t^x \Delta x + \theta_t^y \Delta y
$$

So each 2D complex pair is basically a linear functional $v_t \cdot \Delta p$ where $v_t = (\theta_t^x, \theta_t^y)$ .

All heads/layers get a bunch of such linear functionals in parallel, one per frequency/channel pair.

---

### MonSTERs (your Minkowski Space‑Time Embedding Rotors)

MonSTERs generalize RoPE from 2D Euclidean rotations to **4D Lorentz transforms** in Minkowski space $Cl(1,3)$ . Conceptually:

- Position is a 4‑vector $s = (t, x, y, z)$ in lattice units with $c = 1$ .
- For each **frequency bucket** $j$ , you build an effective Lorentz rotor depending linearly on $s$ , and you apply it blockwise to the embedding. The vectorized implementation you wrote does:
	- Frequencies: $\lambda_j = \text{base}^{-j/F}$ for $F = \text{dim}/12$ .
	- Angles / rapidities:
		$$
		\phi_j = (t \cdot u)\,\lambda_j,\quad
		\theta^x_j = (x \cdot u)\,\lambda_j,\quad
		\theta^y_j = (y \cdot u)\,\lambda_j,\quad
		\theta^z_j = (z \cdot u)\,\lambda_j
		$$
	- For each frequency, you have **3 triads** (X, Y, Z), each a 4‑vector block $[t,x,y,z]$ . The triad update does:
		1. A Lorentz **boost** mixing $t$ and the axis‑aligned spatial component (e.g. $t \leftrightarrow x$ for the X triad) using $\cosh \phi_j, \sinh \phi_j$ .
		2. A **spatial rotation** in the plane orthogonal to that axis (e.g. rotate $(y,z)$ by $\theta^x_j$ in the X triad, $(x,z)$ by $\theta^y_j$ in the Y triad, etc.).
- You proved the RoPE‑style **absolute → relative identity** in code:
	$$
	\langle L(s_q)\,q,\; L(s_k)\,k \rangle_\eta
	= \langle q,\; L(s_k - s_q)\,k \rangle_\eta
	$$
	for the big Minkowski metric, and you check per‑block Minkowski norm preservation.

So mixed RoPE lives in **SO(2)** per 2D block (one scalar angle per block), while MonSTERs live in a constrained chunk of **SO(1,3)** per 4D block (one rapidity + up to three rotation angles per triad per frequency).

---

### “Which is stronger?”

If we mean **geometric expressiveness per block**, MonSTERs are strictly richer:

- Mixed RoPE:
	- 1 angle per 2D block, of the form $v_t \cdot (x, y)$ .
	- Group is abelian: compositions add phases.
- MonSTERs (Triad version):
	- For each frequency you have **4 independent linear forms** in $(t, x, y, z)$ : one rapidity and three spatial angles.
	- You then compose **non‑commuting** boosts + rotations per axis triad.
	- Group is non‑abelian (subset of the Lorentz group), so rotations about different axes interact nontrivially.

So, in terms of **how “big” the family of transforms is**, MonSTERs are more powerful—they can represent any function of $\Delta p$ that arises from a product of axis‑aligned boosts and 3D rotations with angles linear in $\Delta p$ . Mixed RoPE can only give you products of 2D rotations whose angles are linear forms in $(x,y)$ .

That said:

- For **pure 2D image grids with no explicit time/z**, mixed RoPE is likely the more *targeted* and parameter‑efficient option; MonSTERs are overkill unless you really want explicit 3D/4D structure.
- For **true 3D or spatiotemporal tasks** (videos, trajectories, world‑models, etc.), MonSTERs give you principled handling of time vs space, causal structure, and richer directional coupling than any 2D RoPE variant.

So “stronger” in a geometric / group‑theoretic sense: **MonSTERs**.  
“Stronger” in the narrow sense of “fixing diagonals in a 2D grid”: **both can**, see below.

---

## 2\. Does mixed RoPE’s learned mixing actually solve the diagonal problem?

Let’s formalize the “diagonal problem” first.

### Axial 2D RoPE

Axial 2D RoPE (what EVA‑02 / FiT used) does:

$$
R_x(n, t) = e^{i\theta_t p^x}, \quad
R_y(n, t) = e^{i\theta_t p^y}
$$

with separate halves of the dimensions allocated to x and y.

So for a relative displacement $\Delta p = (\Delta x, \Delta y)$ :

- Half the channels see phases $\theta_t \Delta x$
- The other half see phases $\theta_t \Delta y$

There is **no single 2D block whose phase is a joint function** like $\theta (\Delta x + \Delta y)$ . Any diagonal behavior has to be “synthesized” downstream via learned linear combinations of these axis‑separable channels.

That’s what Heo et al. call out as the diagonal limitation: RoPE already “spent” the query‑key multiplication on encoding relative positions, so there’s no room left inside a single complex pair to mix x and y.

---

### Mixed RoPE

RoPE‑Mixed changes each 2D block’s phase to:

$$
\phi_t(p) = \theta_t^x p_x + \theta_t^y p_y
$$

So under a displacement $\Delta p$ :

$$
\phi_t(\Delta p) = \theta_t^x \Delta x + \theta_t^y \Delta y
                 = v_t \cdot \Delta p, \quad v_t \in \mathbb{R}^2
$$

Now you can **choose** $v_t$ to align with any direction in the plane:

- Axis‑aligned: $v_t = (1, 0)$ → pure x
- Diagonal: $v_t = (\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$ → phase depends on $\Delta x + \Delta y$
- Arbitrary orientation: $v_t = (\cos\alpha, \sin\alpha)$ → phase ~ projection of $\Delta p$ onto direction $\alpha$ .

Because each frequency/channel pair has its own $v_t$ , and they’re learned, the representation **can** allocate some dimensions to diagonals, others to vertical/horizontal, others to weird oblique directions, etc. Nothing in the parameterization prevents that.

Formally:

- In axial RoPE, all phase gradients lie in the set $\{(c,0), (0,c)\}$ → you only get pure x or pure y.
- In mixed RoPE, phase gradients per block are arbitrary $v_t \in \mathbb{R}^2$ . Pick any set of at least **two non‑collinear** $v_t$ ’s and the map $\Delta p \mapsto (\phi_{t_1}, \phi_{t_2}, \dots)$ is full‑rank in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (up to periodicity). Directions like $(1,1)$ and $(1,0)$ land in **different** phase patterns almost everywhere.

So in a **capacity** sense:

> Yes, mixed RoPE genuinely removes the axial degeneracy – it lets the model allocate channels that are intrinsically diagonal‑sensitive (or any other orientation‑sensitive) at the level of the positional code itself, not only via downstream mixing.

The catch:

- It does **not** *guarantee* that training will use those directions; it only makes them representable.
- There is no explicit regularizer to enforce isotropy or to span all directions uniformly.

---

## 3\. What mathematical proof do they give that diagonals are “solved”?

Short version: **there’s no formal proof**, only a constructive argument and empirical evidence.

The RoPE‑ViT paper:

- Shows the axial formulation: angles depend on a single axis and “cannot be converted to mixed frequency … there is no way to mix axial frequencies for diagonal direction.”
- Introduces RoPE‑Mixed with
	$$
	R(n,t) = e^{i(\theta_t^x p_x + \theta_t^y p_y)}
	$$
	and states that “By using two frequencies for each axis, RoPE enables to handle the diagonal axis.”

But:

- They do **not** prove a theorem like “for any orientation $\alpha$ , there exists a configuration of $(\theta_t^x,\theta_t^y)$ that realizes it,” even though that’s true by trivial linear algebra.
- They do **not** prove anything about uniform directional coverage or isotropy.

What they *do* provide is:

- A mathematical **construction** that clearly allows oblique directions (as we just walked through).
- Extensive **empirical results**: RoPE‑Mixed consistently beats RoPE‑Axial on multi‑resolution ImageNet, COCO detection, and ADE‑20K segmentation, with especially large gains when extrapolating or under strong resolution shifts.

So the “proof” is:

- Theory: “we changed the angle to a full linear form in $(x,y)$ , so now we can express diagonals.”
- Practice: “and empirically it works a lot better than axial RoPE on tasks where diagonal structure matters.”

If you’re asking in the **strict math sense** —no, there is no theorem about diagonal optimality or uniform coverage.

---

## Where MonSTERs sit relative to that diagonal story

Your MonSTERs have a similar “constructive but not fully formal” proof story, but in a richer group:

- You’ve already demonstrated the RoPE‑style **absolute→relative identity** and **Minkowski norm preservation** numerically for arbitrary 4D positions and random embeddings.
- Each scalar angle/rapidity is a linear functional in $(t,x,y,z)$ , so the dependence on direction in spacetime is via a set of linear forms, just like mixed RoPE but now in 4D.

For pure 2D spatial use (say $t = z = 0$ ):

- The triad structure rotates different spatial planes (yz, xz, xy) with angles proportional to $x$ or $y$ , and composes them.
- Diagonal displacements like $(\Delta x, \Delta y)$ obviously lead to distinct combinations of these plane rotations compared to purely axial moves.
- Because you apply this per frequency and per triad, the map $\Delta p \mapsto$ “total rotor” is again a stack of linear forms in $(x,y)$ , but with more degrees‑of‑freedom and non‑commuting composition in SO(3)/SO(1,3).

So:

- Mixed RoPE: **sufficient** to fix the 2D diagonal issue at the positional encoding level; proven by construction but not by a formal theorem.
- MonSTERs: **strictly more expressive geometrically**, handling diagonals as a special case inside a 4D Lorentz framework, with a verified RoPE‑style identity and norm preservation, but again no formal theorem about diagonal optimality.

---

If you want, we can next:

- Write out an explicit little lemma that formalizes the “axial vs mixed” injectivity on directions (i.e., when does the map $\Delta p \mapsto (\phi_t)_t$ lose orientation info?), and
- Do the analogous analysis for your MonSTER triads (rank of the angle map in 2D vs 4D), to make the “stronger” claim precise in linear‑algebra terms.

Short answer: yes, you *can* make MonSTER “more powerful” by learning the spatial axes instead of hard‑wiring the X/Y/Z triad—but you have to be careful to keep the nice RoPE‑style properties, and the gain is mostly in **inductive bias / isotropy**, not in some magic new function class.

Let me unpack it in MonSTER terms.

---

## 1\. What the triad is doing now

Right now, your TriadMonSTERFastVec does this:

- Positions: $s = (t, x, y, z)$ .
- For each frequency $j$ , you compute
	$$
	\phi_j = (t \cdot u)\lambda_j,\quad
	\theta^x_j = (x \cdot u)\lambda_j,\quad
	\theta^y_j = (y \cdot u)\lambda_j,\quad
	\theta^z_j = (z \cdot u)\lambda_j .
	$$
- Then, per frequency, per “axis slot” (X, Y, Z):
	1. **Boost** in the $(t,\,\text{axis})$ plane with rapidity $\phi_j$ .
	2. **Rotate** in the spatial plane orthogonal to that axis:
		- X‑slot: rotate (y,z) by $\theta^x_j$
		- Y‑slot: rotate (x,z) by $\theta^y_j$
		- Z‑slot: rotate (x,y) by $\theta^z_j$ .

All of that preserves the Minkowski norm per 4‑D block and satisfies your RoPE‑style identity:

$$
\langle L(s_q)q,\; L(s_k)k\rangle_\eta
= \langle q,\; L(s_k - s_q)k\rangle_\eta.
$$

The “triad” part is just: **we chose the spatial axes to be the coordinate basis $(\hat x,\hat y,\hat z)$** for every frequency and every head.

---

## 2\. What “learned axes” would mean

Natural generalization:

1. Introduce a **learned 3×3 orthogonal matrix** $R\in SO(3)$ (or one per head / per frequency).
2. Before you compute the angles, rotate the spatial coordinates:
	$$
	\begin{pmatrix}
	x'\\y'\\z'
	\end{pmatrix}
	= R
	\begin{pmatrix}
	x\\y\\z
	\end{pmatrix}.
	$$
3. Run the *same* TriadMonSTERFastVec logic on $(t, x', y', z')$ instead of $(t, x,y,z)$ :
	$$
	\phi_j = (t u)\lambda_j,\quad
	\theta^x_j = (x' u)\lambda_j,\;
	\theta^y_j = (y' u)\lambda_j,\;
	\theta^z_j = (z' u)\lambda_j.
	$$

Geometrically, that’s “learned axes”:

- The three axis‑triads now live along three **learned spatial directions** (columns of $R$ ) instead of the canonical x, y, z.

Algebraically:

- You’ve replaced the fixed linear functionals $x,y,z$ by three learned linear functionals  
	$(r_1\cdot \mathbf{s}_{space}, r_2\cdot \mathbf{s}_{space}, r_3\cdot \mathbf{s}_{space})$ , where $r_i$ are the rows of $R$ .

The entire MonSTER map is now:

$$
s \mapsto L_{\text{triad}}(t, R\,[x,y,z]^\top),
$$

with the same Lorentz‑isometry machinery underneath.

---

## 3\. Does that make it “more powerful”?

In a strict sense: **yes**.

- The *current* triad is the special case $R = I$ .
- Allowing $R$ to be learned gives you a **strict superset** of possible position→rotor maps.
- Any kernel you can build with the fixed triad you can still build (just set $R \approx I$ ), plus you can align the triad axes with whatever directions in the data are actually important (e.g., camera axes, dominant motion directions, etc.).

In other words, the family of Lorentz transforms

$$
\{ L(t, x, y, z) \}
$$

you can realize is bigger once you allow a learned rotation of $(x,y,z)$ first.

However, there are *two caveats*:

### (a) You already have some axis freedom through Q/K

Remember that before MonSTER touches anything, you’ve applied learned linear maps $W_q, W_k$ :

$$
q = W_q h,\quad k = W_k h.
$$

Those weights are free to “tilt” the embedding basis so that each 4‑D block encodes whatever spatial & semantic mixture is useful. MonSTER then rotates/boosts *that* basis.

So there is already significant freedom to “realign” the effective axes in embedding space. A learned spatial rotation $R$ on $(x,y,z)$ gives you **explicit geometric axis learning** in *position space*, but some of the same effect can be emulated indirectly by how the model learns to use its embedding dimensions.

### (b) You mustn’t break the RoPE‑style identity

Your nice identity

$$
\langle L(s_q)q,\; L(s_k)k\rangle_\eta
= \langle q,\; L(s_k - s_q)k\rangle_\eta
$$

relies on two facts:

1. Angles/rapidities are **linear in position** (so that shifting positions adds angles).
2. The transforms in each 4‑D block are **Minkowski isometries** (so you can move them between q/k inside the inner product).

If you pre‑rotate coordinates by a fixed $R$ , you still have:

- linear dependence on position (composition of linear maps), and
- Lorentz isometries in each block.

So the identity continues to hold exactly. The analytic proof you already sketched for the current triad basically goes through with an extra linear map composed into the angles.

If you instead tried to make the *bivectors* themselves learned and frequency‑dependent in an arbitrary way (i.e., rotating the *Lorentz generators* per frequency, not just the coordinates), then you have to be more careful: you’d want all the exponentials $e^{\phi_j(s)B_j}$ to combine into a representation $L(s_1+s_2) = L(s_1)L(s_2)$ . That pushes you into commutation / Cartan‑subalgebra territory in $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$ , which is a lot trickier than “just add a rotation in $\mathbb{R}^3$ ”.

So:

- **Learned spatial axes via an SO(3) on (x,y,z) is safe.**
- Completely arbitrary learned Lorentz generators per frequency is *not* obviously safe if you want the RoPE identity to hold exactly.

---

## 4\. Is it worth it?

Conceptually:

- If you care about **isotropy** and want the model to discover “natural” spatial axes (e.g., in 3D point clouds, game worlds, etc.), then letting MonSTER learn a global or per‑head $R$ is a very reasonable upgrade:
	- The current triad is biased toward the data’s original coordinate frame.
	- Learned axes let MonSTER’s structure adapt to the true geometry instead of whatever coordinate system you happened to choose.

Practically:

- It adds a **tiny number of parameters** (a few orthogonal matrices) compared to the rest of the model.
- You’d want to parametrize $R$ in a numerically stable way (e.g., exponential map of a skew‑symmetric matrix, or Gram–Schmidt on 3 unconstrained vectors).
- Training might benefit more in regimes where spatial orientation really matters (e.g., 3D / video) than in toy 2D grids.

And importantly:

- You don’t lose anything: the old MonSTER triad is just the special case where $R = I$ .

---

**Bottom line**

- **Yes**, MonSTER can be made strictly more expressive (in the positional sense) by using learned spatial axes—e.g., by inserting a learned SO(3) rotation on $(x,y,z)$ before your existing triad logic.
- Doing it this way **preserves** your Lorentz‑isometry and RoPE‑style absolute→relative identity.
- The gain is mostly better **geometric inductive bias / isotropy**, not a totally new class of functions; the Q/K projection already gives you a lot of flexibility.

If you want, I can sketch a concrete “MonSTER + learned axes” API (what parameters to add, how to enforce orthogonality, and how it would slot into your existing TriadMonSTERFastVec implementation).

Totally fair question 🙂 Short version:

- If by “learned axes” you mean **just rotate the spatial basis and keep 3 axis‑slots**, you still have triads (they’re just not tied to x/y/z anymore).
- If you go all the way to a **single learned rotor per 4‑D block** (or a general learned bivector basis), then yeah—that’s basically *not* a triad anymore; you’d be in the “monolithic rotor” regime from your R\_eff writeup.

Let me separate the cases more cleanly.

---

## 1\. What “triads” are doing in your current code

Right now, per frequency you do:

- Split 12 dims → 3 blocks of 4: X‑triad, Y‑triad, Z‑triad.
- Each 4‑D block is $(t,x,y,z)$ .
- Each triad gets:
	- a **boost** mixing $t$ with *its* spatial component (X: $t\leftrightarrow x$ , Y: $t\leftrightarrow y$ , Z: $t\leftrightarrow z$ ), using the same $\phi_j$ , and
	- a **rotation** in the plane orthogonal to that axis (X: (y,z), Y: (x,z), Z: (x,y)) with angles $\theta^x_j,\theta^y_j,\theta^z_j$ .

So “triad” really means:

- 3 parallel 4‑D Lorentz transforms per frequency, each with its own axis structure, all driven by linear functions of $(t,x,y,z)$ .
- Axes are *hard‑coded* to the coordinate basis.

The group‑theoretic RoPE identity and Minkowski norm preservation you checked are for this triad scheme specifically.

---

## 2\. Option A: Learned triads (still triads)

One way to add learned axes is:

- Keep the triad packing and the idea of 3 “axis slots”.
- Insert a **learned SO(3) rotation** $R$ on the spatial coordinates before you feed them into TriadMonSTER:
	$$
	(x',y',z')^\top = R\,(x,y,z)^\top
	$$
- Then build angles from $(t, x', y', z')$ instead of $(t,x,y,z)$ .

You now have 3 triads, but they’re aligned with **learned spatial directions** (columns of $R$ ) instead of literal x/y/z. Everything else—scalar tables, fast closed forms, RoPE identity—still works the same because the Lorentz generators are fixed and the angles are still linear in $s$ .

That is: you *do* still “do triads”; they’re just no longer bound to the raw coordinate axes.

You could also generalize further: each triad gets its own learned axis vector and you keep the block‑diagonal 3×4‑D structure. Still triads—just learned.

---

## 3\. Option B: Monolithic learned rotor per block (no real triads)

In your 4‑Dimension doc you also sketched the **single‑axis R\_eff** version:

- For each 4‑D block, compute a spatial displacement $\Delta s_b$ ,
- Use one axis $u = \Delta s_b / \|\Delta s_b\|$ , one rapidity $\phi_b$ , and one spatial angle $\theta_b$ ,
- Build a boost and rotation about that *same* axis and compose them:  
	$R_{\text{eff},b} = M_{\text{boost},b} M_{\text{rot},b}$ .

If you now make that axis (or the bivectors) **learned** rather than “direction of $\Delta s_b$ ”, and you only have **one such rotor per 4‑D block per frequency**, then:

- You *don’t* really have an X/Y/Z triad structure anymore.
- You just have a family of learned Lorentz rotors $L_j(s)$ mapping 4‑D positions to SO(1,3).

That’s more like a 4‑D version of RoPE‑Mixed / ComRoPE: a single learned geometric transform per block, with angles linear in the 4‑D position.

So in this design, yeah: you **drop triads** and go with “one learned axis per block (or a small learned bivector basis)”. Triads were originally your way of giving each frequency three axis‑aligned “views” (X,Y,Z) cheaply; once you have a full learned rotor, that role changes.

---

## 4\. Why you might still want triads, even with learning

Reasons to keep *some* notion of triads (even if the axes are learned):

- **Parameterization simplicity & speed**:  
	Three small 4×4 transforms with closed forms (your current code) are cheap and easy to vectorize. A general learned bivector basis is heavier and trickier to constrain.
- **Nice proofs and invariants**:  
	Your current proofs of:
	- Minkowski norm preservation
	- RoPE‑style absolute→relative identity  
		are already worked out for the triad structure. Extending those to a fully general learned Lie‑algebra map $s \mapsto B(s)$ is doable but more involved.
- **Inductive bias**:  
	Triads encode “three canonical spacelike directions” per frequency. If your domains are mostly grid‑like or roughly axis‑aligned, that can be a good bias. Learned axes let you loosen that bias without throwing away the whole triad packing.

---

## 5\. So, answer to your question

> **“Wouldn’t you not do triads anymore if you did learned axes?”**

- If “learned axes” = **rotate the spatial basis / give each triad its own learned axis** →  
	You *still* do triads; they just aren’t literally X/Y/Z.
- If “learned axes” = **one general learned rotor per 4‑D block (or a learned bivector basis)** →  
	Then yes, that’s basically a *non‑triad* MonSTER (the monolithic R\_eff flavor), and you’d probably drop the triad concept and treat it as a general 4‑D RoPE.

Both are reasonable designs; they just sit at different points on the “clean math & bias vs raw expressivity” spectrum.

I think MonSTERs is more than just fancy math, **but** whether it has real, practical bite depends a lot on what you point it at and how disciplined you are with experiments.

Let me break it down in concrete terms.

---

## What MonSTERs actually gives you

From your notes + code, MonSTERs is not a random math flex; it has very specific, RoPE-like properties:

- You extend RoPE’s SO(2) rotations to **SO(1,3)** Lorentz transforms in 4D blocks.
- You **preserve a metric** (Minkowski instead of Euclidean): each 4‑D chunk keeps its Minkowski norm under the transform.
- You proved / numerically verified a RoPE‑style identity:
	$$
	\langle L(s_q)q,\; L(s_k)k\rangle_\eta
	= \langle q,\; L(s_k - s_q)k\rangle_\eta,
	$$
	i.e. absolute spacetime positions collapse to **relative spacetime displacement** inside attention.
- The TriadMonSTERFastVec implementation is fully vectorized, with cheap closed‑form cosh/sinh + cos/sin updates per frequency; no heavy 4×4 matrix multiplies.

Those are exactly the kinds of structural properties that made original RoPE so compelling. This is not “weird nonlinear junk glued onto attention”; it’s a clean group‑theoretic generalization.

So conceptually:

- For each frequency bucket, you’re saying: “I have a tiny 4D Minkowski space; I apply a Lorentz transformation whose parameters are linear in (t, x, y, z).”
- Across buckets, you get a multiscale, 4D version of RoPE’s Fourier-ish coverage.

That’s a real, coherent design, not fluff.

---

## Where I think MonSTERs has real potential

I’d expect nontrivial upside in domains where the data is naturally multi‑D and spatiotemporal, and where **structure generalization** matters more than squeezing another 0.1 BLEU on a text benchmark.

### 1\. Video / trajectories / world models

Anywhere you have **time + space** and care about:

- consistent behavior under translations and rotations,
- different behavior for “timelike” vs “spacelike” separations (e.g., causal vs non‑causal interactions),

MonSTERs gives you:

- a *native* 4D spacetime encoding rather than “flatten + 1D pos + hope attention figures it out”;
- the RoPE‑style relative property, but now in 4D: attention depends on Δt and Δx,Δy,Δz in a principled way.

That’s directly aligned with your “space‑time intelligence” story.

### 2\. Synthetic reasoning tasks (ARC, Sudoku‑like, games)

You’re already thinking in this direction: encode grids / boards / worlds as coordinates and let MonSTER enforce a consistent geometry.

Compared to:

- 1D flattening + RoPE (your Sudoku setup)
- or 2D RoPE / axial RoPE,

MonSTERs gives the model:

- richer directional structure (not just x/y but 4D),
- Lorentz‑like coupling between “time” and “space” inside the positional code.

If your training distribution actually exercises those degrees of freedom (rotations, shifts, time reorderings, etc.), this can translate into better *zero‑shot* generalization when puzzles are permuted, rotated, mirrored, or time‑warped.

### 3\. Physics‑y or continuous spatial data

For neural fields, dynamics, or anything where Minkowski‑style structure is not totally insane, having PEs that **already respect an indefinite metric** and composition law is attractive. You’re basically baking in a little bit of “the world is 4D and has light‑cone‑like structure” into the attention kernel.

Even if you don’t model real relativity, the math of:

- a time‑like component,
- three space‑like components,
- and transformations that preserve a pseudo‑norm,

is a reasonable inductive bias for a ton of simulators and control worlds.

---

## Where it might not shine

There are also places where MonSTERs is likely overkill or even counter‑productive:

- **Plain text LLMs.**  
	Tokens are 1D, and their “positions” aren’t physical. Most of the geometry you’d like is along the sequence dimension; RoPE or ALiBi already work extremely well. Going full Lorentz to encode an index `m` feels like a mismatch.
- **Tasks with no meaningful spatial geometry.**  
	If the coordinates you feed into MonSTER are arbitrary IDs or categorical attributes, your nice group structure isn’t aligned with the data; you’re just adding structure that the model then has to fight.
- **When the Minkowski assumption is wrong.**  
	If your “time” and “space” dimensions really should be Euclidean, not pseudo‑Euclidean, the hyperbolic + circular mixture might be an awkward bias.

---

## The “fancy math” risk

There *is* some “fancy math risk” here, to be honest:

- You’re using the Lorentz group, Clifford algebra language, and Minkowski metrics. That’s beautiful, but deep math alone doesn’t guarantee better learning.
- Many elegant geometric encodings in the literature end up losing to **simpler, ugly hacks** because:
	- they’re harder to optimize,
	- they don’t align with the quirks of real data,
	- or they add complexity without a clear inductive‑bias win.

So I’d frame it like this:

> MonSTERs is very well‑founded mathematically, not hand‑wavy at all, but its **value is 100% empirical**. Until you show consistent wins vs strong baselines on the right benchmarks, it *is* “just fancy math” in the eyes of the community.

That’s not a dig; that’s just how this game works.

---

## How I’d de‑risk it and actually test “potential”

If I were you, I’d do a tight, brutal set of ablations to answer:

> “Does this structure actually buy me sample efficiency or out‑of‑distribution generalization?”

Concrete plan:

1. **Pick one domain at a time.**  
	E.g. ARC‑style grid tasks, or a small video/trajectory world model. No mixing.
2. **Compare against strong but simple baselines:**
	- 1D RoPE on a flattened sequence.
	- 2D RoPE‑Mixed (for images/grids).
	- Maybe ALiBi / T5‑bias if relevant.
3. **Measure where MonSTERs *should* shine:**
	- Generalization to unseen grid sizes or frame counts.
	- Rotated / mirrored / shifted scenes.
	- Reordered time segments or partial observability.
	- Data efficiency: how many samples until you hit X% accuracy.
4. **Keep MonSTER variants small:**
	- TriadMonSTERFastVec as you have it.
	- Maybe one learned‑axis version vs fixed axes, to see if axis learning matters at all.

If you can show that:

- on e.g. ARC‑like spatial puzzles, MonSTERs gets better zero‑shot generalization to new layouts than 2D RoPE‑Mixed,
- or that on a toy video world, it learns causal structure faster than 1D RoPE/ALiBi,

then you absolutely have something that’s not “just fancy math”.

---

## My honest answer

So if I had to answer your question directly:

- **Is MonSTER “just fancy math”?**  
	No. It’s a principled, group‑theoretic 4D generalization of RoPE that preserves all the nice RoPE identities in a new setting.
- **Does it have real potential?**  
	Yes— *especially* for spatiotemporal / world‑model / puzzle domains where geometry and time are central, and where we care about structural generalization rather than squeezing tiny gains on language tasks.

But right now, MonSTERs is at the “beautiful idea, strong math, high plausibility” stage. To move it into “real potential proven,” you need those surgical experiments.

If you want, I can help you lay out a very minimal ARC‑style or grid‑world benchmark + code sketch that would give you a clean A/B between:

- Flatten + 1D RoPE
- 2D RoPE‑Mixed
- MonSTERs (Triad)

so you can get a hard yes/no signal quickly.

For a demo, would a good idea be to take Karpathy's NanoChat repo and train a GPT2 sized generative model for each of the following positional encoding mechanisms, using: - 1d RoPE - Axial RoPE - MonSTERs For the following tasks: 1. Solving a Rubiks Cube 2. Arbitrarily Sized Matrix Multiplication 3. Tic-Tac-Toe 4. Materials Generation (https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/) Ideally the tasks should be super simple and easy to setup for training where we can show a clear contrast between the tasks where the only variation is the encoding mechanism. This gets difficult to decide how to set it up because what is a truly fair comparison? Like if we want meta-learning to be a key skill, then on like an arc task with 3 example grid pairs and a test grid pair with a given starting grid, then is the comparison between axial RoPE with 3 dimensions (x, y, grid #) or is it (x, y) and it can't see the examples, it can only train on the examples? Or what? Like what is fair here?

I like the *spirit* of that idea a lot (same tiny GPT, only swap the positional/structural encoding, compare on geometry‑heavy tasks), but the exact task list and “fairness” needs a bit of sanding to be sane.

Let me break it into:

1. Is “NanoChat + GPT‑2‑ish + 1D RoPE vs Axial RoPE vs MonSTERs” a good demo setup?
2. How to think about **fairness** (especially for meta‑learning / ARC‑style tasks).
3. Thoughts on each of your four tasks + what I’d actually start with.

---

## 1\. Overall setup: yes, but keep it tight

Using a single, simple GPT‑like transformer (NanoChat/NanoGPT‑style) and only swapping:

- **1D RoPE** (standard, on sequence index)
- **2D / Axial RoPE** (RoPE over multiple axes)
- **MonSTERs** (4D Lorentz RoPE)

is a great way to show “this isn’t just fancy math”: same architecture, same training data, only the structural embedding changes.

For MonSTERs you already have a vectorized “Triad” implementation that:

- groups dims into 4D blocks,
- applies boosts + rotations with angles linear in spacetime position,
- preserves Minkowski norm and satisfies the RoPE‑style absolute→relative identity.

So plugging it into a GPT stack is mostly a wiring problem, not a research problem.

The *hard* part is what you already noticed: defining tasks and inputs so the comparison is meaningfully fair.

---

## 2\. What is “fair” for 1D RoPE vs Axial vs MonSTER?

Think in terms of **information** and **inductive bias**:

- **Information fairness:**  
	All models should, in principle, have access to the same underlying coordinates / examples. You shouldn’t hide example grids from one model and not the others.
- **Inductive‑bias difference:**  
	It’s *okay* that MonSTERs encode a 4D position and axial RoPE encodes a 2D/3D position and 1D RoPE encodes a scalar index. That’s literally what you are comparing: what happens when the *only* change is “how do we use position / structure?”

A clean way to think about it for ARC‑style / matrix / board tasks:

### 2.1 Define a common “world coordinate” tuple

For each token, define something like:

- `g` – which grid / example it belongs to (0,1,2,3 for 3 shots + query)
- `r,c` – row, column in the grid
- `role` – input vs output vs query (or matrix A/B/C, etc.)
- maybe `t` – ordering index if you need a temporal step

Every model gets **the same tuple** per token; they just encode it differently.

### 2.2 Then plug that tuple differently for each PE:

**1D RoPE baseline**

- Position fed to RoPE: just a *flattened* token index `m` (0 … L‑1).
- The `(g, r, c, role)` are fed as **learned type/segment embeddings** (added to the token embedding), not into RoPE itself.

So 1D RoPE knows about roles, grid ID, etc., but only via learned embeddings, not via a structured geometry.

**Axial / multi‑D RoPE**

- Decide on 2D or 3D axes, e.g.:
	- 2D: `(r,c)` as RoPE position; `g` and `role` as learned embeddings; or
	- 3D: `(g,r,c)` as axial RoPE axes; `role` as learned embedding.
- Sequence is still flattened, but RoPE gets the multi‑axis coordinates instead of a scalar index.

**MonSTERs**

- Use a 4D spacetime coordinate, e.g.:
	- `t = token step or example index`
	- `x = r`, `y = c`
	- `z = role` or `grid_id` (depending on task)
- Feed `(t,x,y,z)` into your TriadMonSTERFastVec, get the 4D Lorentz transform per block.

The **underlying coordinates** are identical; only the way they are encoded into the attention geometry differs. That’s fair.

### 2.3 For meta‑learning / few‑shot ARC‑style

> “Is the comparison axial RoPE with 3 axes (x,y,grid#) vs axial RoPE with (x,y) and it can’t see the examples?”

I’d say:

- **All models must see the examples in‑context** if meta‑learning is the point. So the full sequence contains `[ex1_input, ex1_output, ex2_input, ex2_output, ex3_input, ex3_output, query_input, query_output?]`.
- For fairness, do *not* hide example grids from any model. The difference should be how they encode the coordinates of those examples, not whether they see them.

Concretely:

- For axial RoPE, I would absolutely feel okay using 3D axes `(grid_idx, r, c)` – that’s its “native” structural story.
- For 1D RoPE, grid index is only a learned embedding.
- For MonSTER, grid index could be `t` (like “which segment”) or `z` while `(x,y)` are rows/cols.

You are *testing*:

> Does giving the model a more faithful structural embedding of this 3D/4D world (axial or MonSTER) help it meta‑learn from few examples better than a plain 1D flatten?

That’s exactly the point.

---

## 3\. Thoughts on your four tasks

Let’s go one by one, with “is this a good *first* demo?” in mind.

### 3.1 Solving a Rubik’s Cube

Cool, but heavy.

- You’d need:
	- a state representation (6×3×3 faces → positions (face,row,col)),
	- a solver or dataset of (scramble → solution) sequences,
	- and a training objective (next‑move prediction? full solution sequence?).
- It’s more like model‑based RL / planning than a clean supervised demo.
- The geometry is 3D and group‑theoretic (the cube group), not “Euclidean grid” per se. MonSTER’s 4D Minkowski story doesn’t line up naturally here.

For a *first* MonSTER vs RoPE demo, I’d skip Rubik’s. It’s too much non‑PE complexity.

---

### 3.2 Arbitrarily sized matrix multiplication

This is actually an excellent task.

Why it’s nice:

- Completely synthetic → easy to generate infinite data.
- Naturally 2D: entries live at `(i,j)` in matrices A, B, C.
- You can test **generalization to sizes larger than training** (train on up to 5×5, test on 10×10, etc.).
- The mapping rules are clean and exact.

How to set it up:

- Input sequence contains:
	- optionally a few **example triples** `(A,B,C)` as demonstrations, then
	- a query pair `(A,B)` where the model must output `C = A·B` entry by entry.

For fairness:

- Use the same tokenization for all three models: tokens like `A[i,j]=v`, `B[i,j]=v`, `C[i,j]=v` or a more compact encoding.
- Shared coordinate tuple per token:  
	`(grid_idx, matrix_role ∈ {A,B,C}, i, j, maybe t)`

Then:

- **1D RoPE**: position = absolute sequence index; `matrix_role`, `i`, `j`, `grid_idx` are just learned embeddings concatenated/added.
- **Axial RoPE**: use `(i,j)` or `(matrix_role,i,j)` as axes; `grid_idx` as embedding.
- **MonSTER**: use something like `(t=grid_idx or within‑sequence step, x=i, y=j, z=matrix_role)` as 4D position to MonSTER.

This is a very controllable, “super simple to generate” task where you can cleanly show:

- sample efficiency,
- generalization to bigger N,
- maybe robustness to permuting rows/cols if you augment.

I’d 100% include this in the first demo.

---

### 3.3 Tic‑Tac‑Toe

Also good, but tiny.

- Board is 3×3 → coordinates `(r,c)`.
- You can represent a board state as 9 tokens or as a little grid.
- Train the model to output:
	- the best next move, or
	- the game outcome from a partial board.

Meta‑learning version: show a few (board → best move) examples, then a query board.

Fairness:

- Same idea: world coordinate tuple `(grid_idx, r, c, role)` with different encodings by 1D vs axial vs MonSTER.

Downside: 3×3 is so small that all three PEs might saturate and look similar. Upside: the code & training are dead simple and it’s easy to visualize.

I’d maybe use Tic‑Tac‑Toe as a **sanity‑check toy** alongside at least one “harder” 2D or 3D grid task.

---

### 3.4 Materials generation (Materials Project)

This is super interesting *long‑term*, but for a first MonSTER demo it’s a lot:

- You need to decide a representation: atoms with 3D positions + species, plus maybe lattice vectors.
- It’s more like a **graph / 3D point cloud** modeling problem than a simple autoregressive toy.
- Evaluating quality requires domain metrics (formation energy, stability, composition distributions, etc.).

MonSTER should be *very* natural here (3D + maybe time → 4D spacetime embedding), but I’d treat materials as a **Phase 2** project:

- First: prove MonSTER vs RoPE on clean synthetics (matmul, grids, maybe toy videos / trajectories).
- Then: move to real 3D scientific data.

---

## 4\. A concrete v1 experiment plan

If you want something doable and clean, I’d recommend:

### v1: Two tasks, three PEs

1. **Matrix multiplication (meta‑learning style)**
	- Train: N in \[2,5\], few example triples + query per sequence.
	- Test: N in \[6,10\].
	- Compare test error vs size and sample efficiency.
2. **Grid pattern / ARC‑lite task**
	- Simple color/bit‑grids: e.g., “copy, flip horizontally, draw diagonal, count & mark majority color,” etc.
	- Format as: 3 example input→output grid pairs + 1 query input; model must generate the query output grid.
	- Shared coordinate tuple `(example_idx, role ∈ {in,out,query}, r, c)` and identical tokenization for all models.

For each:

- Same GPT‑2‑ish model size & training schedule.
- Swap only:
	- RoPE1D(m),
	- AxialRoPE(g,r,c or r,c),
	- MonSTER(t,x,y,z).

Measure:

- In‑distribution performance,
- OOD generalization (sizes, shifts, rotations if you augment),
- maybe speed / stability if you care.

That’s enough to make a compelling “structural embeddings vs positional encodings” story without drowning in Rubik’s solvers or materials science.

---

If you want, I can sketch the exact sequence formats for the matrix‑mul and ARC‑lite tasks (like token layouts and how to map `(g,r,c,role)` to each PE) so you could literally drop it into a NanoChat‑style training loop.

This isn't a fair comparison though, 1D RoPE baseline Position fed to RoPE: just a flattened token index m (0 … L‑1). The (g, r, c, role) are fed as learned type/segment embeddings (added to the token embedding), not into RoPE itself. So 1D RoPE knows about roles, grid ID, etc., but only via learned embeddings, not via a structured geometry. Giving the transformer the g,r,c,role as tokens defeats the purpose? Like we don't give that similar advantage to the MonSTERs model? We could maybe do a "Beginning of Grid" or "End of Grid" or something? but by labeling each position in the tokens we're giving away the answer, are we not?

Yeah, you’re right to be suspicious of that setup as I described it — the way I phrased it would blur what you’re actually trying to test.

Let’s untangle a couple things:

- **What counts as “content” vs “position/structure”**
- **What “fair” should mean in these experiments**
- **How to set up the ARC/meta‑learning style task without accidentally leaking too much**

---

## 1\. You’re right: stuffing (g,r,c,role) into tokens is not what you want

If you literally make the token stream something like:

then:

- You’ve moved “position” into the *content* channel.
- The transformer could, in principle, learn the whole mapping just as a lookup over `(grid_id, r, c)` → `value_out`, *even without any positional encoding at all*.

That’s exactly what you’re worried about when you say “we’re giving away the answer.”  
For a fair test of **positional / structural encoding**, you want:

> **Tokens = data only (plus a few delimiters), positions = only in the PE.**

So I agree: don’t make `(g,r,c,role)` part of the token payload.

---

## 2\. What “fair” should mean here

I’d define fairness like this:

- All models:
	- See **the same 1D token sequence** (same ordering, same delimiters).
	- Have the **same architecture and hyperparams** (same depth, width, heads, etc.).
- The **only** thing that differs is:
	- how we map a token’s *index* (and possibly some pre‑computed coordinates) into its **positional/structural embedding**.

So, concretely:

### 1D RoPE (baseline)

- Tokens: just the grid values + a couple of “separator” tokens like:
	- `<EX1_IN>`, `<EX1_OUT>`, `<EX2_IN>`, …, `<TEST_IN>`, `<TEST_OUT>`.
- Positions:
	- A single integer index `m = 0..L-1` (standard LM).
	- 1D RoPE is applied on `m`.
- No explicit `(g, r, c)` anywhere in the content.

### Axial RoPE

- Tokens: **identical** token stream as 1D RoPE. Same separators, same values.
- Positions:
	- Under the hood, when you build the positional encoding for token `m`, you map it to some multi‑D coordinates like `(grid_idx, row, col)` based on its location in the flattened layout.
	- Axial RoPE uses those multi‑D coords to rotate Q/K.
- Again, `(grid_idx, row, col)` never show up as tokens – they only live inside the PE module.

### MonSTERs

- Tokens: again, exactly the same stream.
- Positions:
	- For token `m`, you compute a 4D coordinate `s = (t, x, y, z)`:
		- e.g. `x,y` = cell coords inside its grid,
		- `t` = which example/test block in the sequence this grid belongs to,
		- `z` = maybe “input vs output” or just 0 everywhere.
	- Feed `s` into your TriadMonSTERFastVec, get the 4D Lorentz rotor for that token, apply it to Q/K.

So: **same tokens, different geometry prior**. That’s the clean comparison.

---

## 3\. “But doesn’t giving grid/coord info in PE give MonSTER an unfair advantage?”

This is the subtle bit: you *do* want to give MonSTER and Axial more geometric info than 1D RoPE, because that’s the **experiment**.

- 1D RoPE only knows: “token #37 is 37 steps from the start.”
- Axial knows: “this token is at `(row, col)` in grid X.”
- MonSTER knows: “this token lives at `(t, x, y, z)` in a 4D lattice.”

That’s not “cheating,” it’s *exactly* what you’re trying to evaluate:

> When the task is genuinely 2D/3D/4D, does a model that has a better structural prior (via PE) **meta‑learn** the mapping more easily and generalize better?

If you want an “extra strict” ablation, you *can* also try:

- a 1D baseline where you **still** keep `(grid_idx, row, col)` *inside* the PE (e.g., encode them as three separate sinusoids or a learned MLP), but the PE is *additive*, not RoPE/MonSTER‑style relative in attention.

That’s another axis of comparison (absolute coordinate features vs relative structural PEs), but it’s a separate thing.

---

## 4\. Delimiters are fine; per‑cell labels are not

Your suggestion:

> We could maybe do a “Beginning of Grid” or “End of Grid” or something?

Yes, exactly:

- Tokens like `<GRID_1_IN>`, `<GRID_1_OUT>`, `<SEP>` etc. are totally fine.
- They act like segment IDs / BOS/EOS in language models — they say “we’re now in this region” but not “this is row 3, col 5”.

That doesn’t give away any mapping; it just helps the model parse where one example ends and another begins.

What you *don’t* want for this particular experiment is:

- Tokens that say “I am the cell at row 3, col 5” (because then you’re testing “model with coordinate tokens” vs “model without coordinate tokens,” which mixes data design with PE design).

---

## 5\. So what does a fair ARC‑style setup look like?

Putting it all together, for **3 example grid pairs + 1 query pair**:

**Token stream (for *all* models):**

No `(g,r,c)` as tokens. Just values + delimiters.

**Positional encoding:**

- 1D RoPE:
	- PE(m): standard RoPE(m).
- Axial RoPE:
	- For each token m, compute `(grid_idx, row, col)` and feed those to an axial RoPE module.
- MonSTER:
	- For each token m, compute `(t, x, y, z)` (e.g. `t=grid_idx`, `x=row`, `y=col`, `z=0`) and feed that to MonSTER.

Everything else (model size, optimizer, data) is identical.

That way:

- You’re not “labeling each position in the tokens.”
- You’re not giving 1D RoPE extra crutches in the content channel.
- The **only** advantage MonSTER / Axial have is the one you *intend*: a richer structural encoding for the same underlying world.

---

If you’d like, next step I can sketch the exact index→(grid\_idx,row,col) mapping and how you’d wire a simple `PositionalEncoder` interface in a NanoChat‑style codebase that can be swapped between `RoPE1D`, `AxialRoPE`, and `MonSTER` with a config flag.

Below is a **tight executive summary**, followed by the **actual mathematical reasons** axial RoPE has those problems. No fluff.

---

## Executive summary (what’s wrong with axial RoPE)

**Axial RoPE is limited because it factorizes multi-dimensional position into independent 1D rotations.**  
This makes it:

1. **Blind to diagonal and oblique directions**  
	– It cannot encode “move (1,1)” as a primitive direction; diagonals only emerge indirectly (and weakly).
2. **Axis-separable by construction**  
	– Position effects along x and y are encoded in disjoint subspaces and never interact at the positional level.
3. **Rigid and hand-designed**  
	– Frequencies are fixed, reused across axes, and evenly split, regardless of data anisotropy.
4. **Poor at hierarchical / multi-scale 2D structure**  
	– It encodes local offsets but not region-level or object-level spatial structure.
5. **Head- and layer-uniform**  
	– All heads see the same axial geometry, even though heads specialize differently.

In practice: axial RoPE works *okay* for local neighborhoods but underperforms whenever geometry, orientation, or extrapolation matter.

---

## The mathematical causes (why this happens)

## 1\. Definition of axial RoPE

For a 2D position $p = (x, y)$ , axial RoPE applies **independent 1D RoPE rotations**:

$$
R(x,y)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
R_x(x) & 0 \\
0 & R_y(y)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where each $R_x, R_y \in SO(2)^{d/4}$ is a block-diagonal rotation matrix.

For queries and keys:

$$
q' = R(x_q,y_q)\,q,\quad
k' = R(x_k,y_k)\,k
$$

The attention inner product becomes:

$$
\langle q', k' \rangle
=
\langle q_x, R_x(\Delta x)\,k_x \rangle
+
\langle q_y, R_y(\Delta y)\,k_y \rangle
$$

with $\Delta x = x_q - x_k$ , $\Delta y = y_q - y_k$ .

---

## 2\. Root problem: block-diagonal separability

The rotation matrix is **block-diagonal across axes**.

That implies:

- Each 2D complex pair encodes **only one axis**.
- No positional feature ever depends on both $x$ *and* $y$ inside the same rotation.

Formally:

$$
\phi_i(x,y) \in \{\theta_i x,\ \theta_i y\}
\quad\text{but never}\quad
\theta_i^x x + \theta_i^y y
$$

So the positional phase gradients live in:

$$
\{(c,0), (0,c)\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2
$$

not in general $(c_1, c_2)$ .

---

## 3\. Why diagonals are fundamentally weak

Consider two relative displacements:

- Axis: $(\Delta x, 0)$
- Diagonal: $(\Delta x, \Delta x)$

In axial RoPE:

- Axis displacement affects **only x-channels**
- Diagonal displacement affects **x-channels and y-channels separately**

There is **no channel whose phase is proportional to**:

$$
\Delta x + \Delta y
$$

So diagonals are **not a primitive direction**; they are reconstructed only by later linear mixing of unrelated channels.

In contrast, mixed RoPE or MonSTERs have channels where:

$$
\phi(\Delta x,\Delta y) = \theta_x \Delta x + \theta_y \Delta y
$$

which makes diagonal sensitivity *intrinsic*, not emergent.

---

## 4\. Why attention can’t “fix it later”

A key subtlety:

> RoPE already uses the query–key dot product to convert absolute → relative position.

That dot product is *already spent* enforcing:

$$
R(p_q)^\top R(p_k) = R(p_q - p_k)
$$

So there is **no remaining multiplicative interaction** where x- and y-phases can mix.

Any mixing must happen **after attention**, via learned projections, which is weaker, data-hungry, and not position-equivariant.

---

## 5\. Frequency rigidity

Axial RoPE also assumes:

- Same frequency spectrum on every axis
- Even split of dimensions per axis
- Fixed base (e.g. 10 000)

Mathematically, it enforces:

$$
\theta_i^x = \theta_i^y = \theta_i
$$

which assumes isotropy and equal scale across dimensions — often false in images, grids, or spatiotemporal data.

---

## 6\. No spatial hierarchy

Because axial RoPE only encodes **pairwise offsets**, it lacks any mechanism for:

- grouping patches into regions,
- encoding “same object” vs “different object”,
- coarse vs fine spatial scale.

Mathematically, all information is encoded in:

$$
R(\Delta x, \Delta y)
$$

with no notion of *nested* or *composed* spatial structure.

---

## One-sentence takeaway

> **Axial RoPE factorizes space into independent 1D rotations; this makes diagonals, orientation, and higher-order spatial structure mathematically inaccessible at the positional-encoding level.**

That’s exactly why later work (RoPE-Mixed, HARoPE, ComRoPE, and your MonSTERs) all break axis separability in different ways.

If you want, I can also give you a **one-slide diagram explanation** or a **formal comparison table vs mixed RoPE vs MonSTERs**.

Here is a **short, executive-style summary** that sticks **only to what can be stated and justified mathematically**, with a brief preface.

---

## What axial RoPE is and why it was introduced

**Axial RoPE** is a straightforward extension of 1D RoPE to multi-dimensional data (e.g. images).  
It was introduced to:

- preserve RoPE’s key property
	$$
	R(p_q)^\top R(p_k) = R(p_q - p_k)
	$$
	so attention depends only on relative position, and
- avoid learning large 2D relative-bias tables by reusing cheap sinusoidal rotations.

To do this, axial RoPE **factorizes position across axes**.  
For a 2D position $p=(x,y)$ , it applies independent 1D RoPE rotations:

$$
R(x,y)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
R_x(x) & 0 \\
0 & R_y(y)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

with half the embedding dimensions allocated to $x$ and half to $y$ .

---

## Mathematically provable shortcomings of axial RoPE

### 1\. Axis separability (block-diagonal structure)

Axial RoPE’s rotation matrix is block-diagonal across axes.

As a consequence:

- every rotational phase depends on **exactly one coordinate**:
	$$
	\phi_i(x,y) \in \{\theta_i x,\ \theta_i y\}
	$$
- there is **no channel** whose phase depends jointly on $(x,y)$ .

This is not an implementation choice; it follows directly from the block-diagonal construction.

---

### 2\. No primitive encoding of diagonal or oblique directions

Because each phase depends on only one axis, axial RoPE cannot encode directions of the form:

$$
\theta_x x + \theta_y y
$$

within a single rotation.

Formally, the set of positional phase gradients spans only:

$$
\{(c,0), (0,c)\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2
$$

and not the full $\mathbb{R}^2$ .

Diagonal displacements $(\Delta x, \Delta y)$ therefore **do not correspond to a distinct positional phase**, but are decomposed into two independent axial effects. Any diagonal sensitivity must be reconstructed later by learned linear mixing, not by the positional encoding itself.

---

### 3\. No positional cross-axis interaction in attention

RoPE uses the query–key dot product to convert absolute position into relative position.  
In axial RoPE, this dot product decomposes additively:

$$
\langle q',k' \rangle
=
\langle q_x, R_x(\Delta x)k_x \rangle
+
\langle q_y, R_y(\Delta y)k_y \rangle
$$

There is **no multiplicative or rotational interaction between axes at the positional level**.  
Once the dot product is taken, the opportunity to mix $x$ and $y$ geometrically is gone.

This limitation follows directly from RoPE’s algebra and cannot be fixed downstream without breaking relative-position equivariance.

---

### 4\. Rigid frequency assignment

Axial RoPE enforces:

- identical frequency spectra on each axis,
- equal dimensional allocation per axis.

Mathematically, it assumes:

$$
\theta_i^x = \theta_i^y
$$

This hard-codes isotropy and equal scale across dimensions, regardless of the data. The model cannot reallocate positional capacity across axes within the RoPE mechanism itself.

---

## One-sentence takeaway

> **Axial RoPE factorizes multi-D position into independent 1D rotations; this makes cross-axis, diagonal, and oblique positional structure mathematically inaccessible at the positional-encoding level.**

That limitation is structural, not empirical, and is exactly what mixed-axis RoPE variants and MonSTER-style constructions remove.

ARC-AGI highlights several shortcomings of the modern transformer stack:

1. positional encoding flaws (anisotropic (diagonal), implicit address, fixed/ordered/static, dimensionality, no nesting or hierarchy of objects)
2. vocab flaws (exploding vocab size, softmax, fixed vocab)
3. 


---

The modern stack starts with:

1. A fixed, predetermined vocabulary
2. A fixed, predetermined context-length, and
3. Uniform treatment of the predetermined vocabulary, within the predetermined context-window, by implicitly assigned, fixed, and predetermined positional encodings.


 


If you had to make the argument that the ARC-AGI challenge highlights the modern transformer model stack's weaknesses and shortcomings, where in particular it highlighted the following weaknesses, what would be your evidence that ARC-AGI in particular highlights the modern stack's lack of a continual learning method?

4. continual learning is not yet possible.


In practice, **most “test-time training” (TTT) is *not* continual learning in the sense of one evolving set of weights that compounds across a long sequence of unrelated tasks**. The dominant pattern depends on the setting.

## 1) In ARC/ARC-Prize-style TTT: it’s almost always “train a variant per task,” then reset

The ARC Prize technical report is unusually explicit about this:

* For ARC-AGI, **TTT means fine-tuning on the demonstration pairs of *each task instance* at test time**, which **“effectively creat[es] a different variant of the base model for each task.”** ([arXiv][1])
* The ARC Prize writeup also describes TTT as “fine-tuning an LLM … on a given ARC-AGI task specification … into a new model adapted to the task at hand.” ([ARC Prize][2])

That is **not** compounding updates across tasks. It’s **per-task specialization**.

Why this structure is typical for ARC:

* ARC tasks are intentionally heterogeneous/novel; **carrying weight updates from puzzle A to puzzle B risks negative transfer / drift** (you can overwrite whatever the base model was “good at”).
* Evaluation is naturally “task episodic”: you can treat each puzzle as its own mini-dataset and then throw away the tuned copy.

So for ARC-AGI, “TTT” is best thought of as **task-local adaptation**, not lifelong learning.

## 2) In the original (vision) TTT literature: both exist, and the paper separates them cleanly

Sun et al.’s original “Test-Time Training” paper makes a sharp distinction between:

### (A) Standard / episodic TTT (no compounding)

* Update the model on the current test sample (via a self-supervised loss), predict, and then **discard the updated parameters**. ([arXiv][3])
  This is explicitly *non-continual*.

### (B) Online TTT (compounding, but only within a stream)

* If test samples arrive sequentially, the online variant **initializes the optimization on sample (x_t)** from the **parameters updated on (x_{t-1})**, so updates **accumulate across the stream**. ([arXiv][3])
  This *does* “compound,” but typically under assumptions like “same domain” or “smoothly changing shift,” not arbitrary new tasks. ([arXiv][3])

So even in the foundational framing: **TTT is not inherently continual-learning**; you choose an episodic vs online mode.

## 3) What “online TTT/TTA” is trying to do is usually *domain adaptation*, not “learn new tasks forever”

A lot of modern work is better described as **test-time adaptation (TTA)** or **online test-time adaptation (OTTA)**: adapting to distribution shift during deployment. The OTTA survey defines this as adapting to novel distributions “upon batch arrival” and accommodating real-time changes in test distribution. ([arXiv][4])

That’s a different objective than classic continual learning:

* OTTA is usually about staying competent as the *input distribution shifts*.
* Continual learning is usually about *accumulating distinct skills/tasks* while retaining prior ones.

Some papers explicitly note that “lifelong/continual” test-time shift is a harder special case and that many existing TTA methods assume a stationary target domain; they add mechanisms to reduce drift and error accumulation. ([CVF Open Access][5])

## 4) Why compounding weight updates across unrelated tasks is uncommon (and when it can work)

### Why it’s uncommon

Compounding updates across tasks is avoided because:

* **Catastrophic forgetting / interference**: later updates can degrade earlier capabilities.
* **Error accumulation / drift**: if adaptation uses pseudo-labels or weak self-supervision, mistakes get reinforced over time (this is a known issue in continual/online TTA). ([CVF Open Access][5])
* **Reproducibility & evaluation leakage**: in benchmarks with many independent tasks, carrying weights forward can blur what was “learned from where.”

### When compounding can make sense

It can work when:

* You truly have a **stream** where samples are from the **same domain** or a **smoothly drifting domain** (e.g., a camera feed, a single user’s data).
* You add **stability mechanisms** (teacher–student/EMA models, anchoring to the source model, partial parameter restoration, etc.). The lifelong TTA line of work exists largely because naive compounding is unstable. ([CVF Open Access][5])

## Bottom line

* **ARC-AGI TTT:** overwhelmingly **per-task variants** (fine-tune for the puzzle, solve, reset). ([arXiv][1])
* **General TTT/TTA:** two common modes:

  * **Episodic**: update → predict → **discard** (not continual). ([arXiv][3])
  * **Online**: updates **accumulate over a stream** (some compounding), but this is usually framed as *test-time adaptation to distribution shift*, not multi-task continual learning. ([arXiv][3])

If you tell me whether you mean “continual learning” as *retain-and-accumulate new puzzle-solving operators over many ARC tasks* versus *adapt continuously to a drifting distribution*, I can map the terms more precisely—those two goals get conflated a lot in TTT discussions.

### Abstract

- No dominant method for tasks beyond 1D / proliferation of variants
- In single-task settings, the encoding method is inconsequential

- Improvements to RoPE come in two flavors:
   - Extensions
   - Compromises
   
- Majority of researchers take the trade:
   - Abandon structural constraint
   - Implement task-specific improvement







While RoPE has become the dominant positional encoding method for 1D tasks, no equivalent 

The absence of a singular favored method for extending 


“The lack of a single, widely adopted scheme for extending positional encodings beyond 1D suggests that, in fixed domains, transformers can often internalize spatial structure without a canonical inductive bias—but that this brittleness shows up when we demand multitask, cross-domain generalization.”

“That the community has not converged on a RoPE-like standard for 2D/3D/4D positional encoding is a sign that many extensions work ‘well enough’ in narrow settings, yet fail to provide the shared, transferable structure needed for multitask learning.”

“The proliferation of incompatible 2D–4D RoPE variants and learned embeddings—without a clear winner—indicates that positional structure is frequently recoverable from task-specific data, but becomes a limiting factor once we move to general-purpose, multitask models.”

“The absence of consensus on higher-dimensional positional encodings points to a mismatch between what suffices for single-task training and what is required for robust, compositional transfer across tasks and modalities.”

“That no RoPE-equivalent has emerged for higher-dimensional inputs suggests that transformers can compensate for imperfect positional bias in constrained regimes, while revealing the need for a principled, shared encoding when scaling to multitask learners.”


Can you help me polish this into a one sentence intro?

The absence of a singular favored method for extending the positional encodings of transformer models to higher dimensions is an indicator that ....

Basically, I'm trying to say, when we extend to 2d, or to 3d, or to 4d, there's been many papers proposing modifications to RoPE, or using learned positional embeddings, but there hasn't been this consolidation around a single method like there has been for RoPE in 1D. I think it's because the transformer is so powerful, that if you only train on a single task, or if you fix the domain of the task, it can learn those relationships anyway. However, when you want to move onto multitask learners, there's where trouble arises. Do you see where I'm trying to go? Can you give me 5 options for that opening sentence? 


To the cowboy scientist, the sheer variety of adaptations made to squeeze current positional encoding mechanisms into additional dimensions, and the clear absence of a de facto standard is nothing short of perplexing. It appears


, modifications, and optimizations made to positional encodings to squeeze them into ~ill fitting domains~ is nothing short of perplexing. 

Radford et al. showed that aligning positional representations with a domain’s true underlying dimensionality can unlock substantial generalization gains, enabling few- or even zero-shot performance on previously unseen tasks.

Radford et al demonstrated that by aligning positional encoding to the domain's actual (reality) dimension/space unleashes previously unimaginable generalization benefits, permitting few or zero shot performance on previously unseen tasks. Taken seriously, this premise suggests that the obvious dimension for an ideal positional encoding mechansim would be spatio-temporal, and that ....

Yes—**for the ViT image encoder in OpenAI’s CLIP, the patch tokens use a learned (trainable) absolute positional embedding**.

In the released OpenAI CLIP code, the VisionTransformer defines `self.positional_embedding` as an `nn.Parameter` with one embedding per patch position **plus one for the class token**, i.e. shape roughly `(grid_size^2 + 1, width)`. ([GitHub][1])

(Separately: CLIP’s **text** encoder also uses a learned absolute positional embedding with a fixed context length—commonly 77 tokens in the released models. ([GitHub][2]))

If you mean **GPT-2** (“Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners”), then the **zero-shot** part is supportable; the **“aligning positional representations with reality’s dimensionality causes it”** part is *your interpretation* and should be framed that way.

### What GPT-2 actually supports (safe to state as fact)

* GPT-2 is trained with a **left-to-right language modeling objective** (next-token prediction).
* The paper reports **zero-shot (and task-structured) performance** on several NLP benchmarks, with stronger results on some tasks (e.g., reading comprehension) and weaker/rudimentary performance on others (e.g., summarization). ([OpenAI CDN][1])

So a “bullet-proof” sentence can anchor on those claims.

### What to avoid (or soften)

> “Next token prediction is only possible in the 1D temporal domain.”

That’s too absolute. Autoregressive prediction only requires **an ordering**; many domains can be linearized (images as raster scans, audio frames, 3D voxels, etc.). What *is* defensible is: language has a **natural sequential order**, and the autoregressive factorization matches that structure.

### A sturdier way to say your “geometry alignment” point

Use **interpretive language** and define what you mean by “geometry”:

**Option A (tight + academic):**

> Radford et al. show that a large transformer trained with next-token prediction can exhibit meaningful zero-shot behavior on a range of NLP tasks. ([OpenAI CDN][1]) One way to interpret this is that language provides a *native 1D ordering*, and the autoregressive objective exploits that inductive bias particularly well.

**Option B (more explicit about the conjecture):**

> GPT-2 demonstrates that next-token pretraining can yield nontrivial zero-shot transfer on several benchmarks. ([OpenAI CDN][1]) We hypothesize that part of what makes this work is structural: text is inherently sequential, so the model’s positional scheme and training objective are aligned with a natural 1D structure of the data.

**Option C (if you want to lean into “geometry” without overclaiming):**

> GPT-2 provides evidence that scaling next-token pretraining yields emergent zero-shot capabilities in language. ([OpenAI CDN][1]) We propose a geometric reading: when the learning problem is posed in a coordinate system that matches the data’s intrinsic structure (for text, a 1D sequence), generalization becomes easier; the spatiotemporal case may demand encodings that are native to 4D structure.

### If you want it truly “bullet-proof”

Make a clean separation between **(1) cited empirical claim** and **(2) your hypothesis**:

> **Empirically**, GPT-2 shows nontrivial zero-shot performance on multiple NLP tasks under a next-token training objective. ([OpenAI CDN][1]) **We conjecture** that this success is helped by the fact that language comes with a natural 1D ordering, so the model’s positional/causal structure matches the data’s dominant organization.

If you paste the next 2–3 sentences after your abstract’s opening, I can rewrite the whole paragraph so the factual claims are tightly attributed and the conjecture reads intentional rather than like a shaky citation.

One of the highest-leverage actions in engineering is removing steps, constraints, or components entirely. 




The absence of a canonical positional encoding in vision is a strong signal that the transformer interface is doing unnecessary work to emulate spatial structure it does not natively support.


1. **Everything that exists has a spacetime address, so a 4D positional code is a universal representational substrate.**

2. **If you can encode *where-and-when* in 3+1 dimensions, you can in principle encode anything that can ever be observed.**

3. **Spacetime is the coordinate system of reality; a 4D positional encoding inherits its generality.**

4. **Any physical fact is an event in spacetime, so encoding 4D position is the shortest path to encoding the world.**

5. **To be task-agnostic across modalities, position must be defined in the one frame shared by all data: spacetime.**

6. **A universal positional prior should not count tokens—it should locate events in 3+1D.**

7. **Because all structure is grounded in relations between events, 4D coordinates provide a modality-independent scaffold for representation.**

8. **Four coordinates—time and three of space—are enough to situate every possible observation.**

9. **Reality is a set of spacetime-localized events; encode that localization and you can represent any reality-grounded task.**

10. **The most general positional encoding is the one the universe uses: a 3+1D coordinate.**

11. **When position lives in spacetime rather than a 1D index, “anything that exists” becomes a valid input.**

12. **If a model can represent 4D displacement, it can represent the relational geometry underlying every physical interaction.**

13. **A representation that can name an event’s (t, x, y, z) can, in principle, name any event.**

14. **Spacetime is the universal container for information; a 4D positional encoding is a universal container for positions.**

15. **To capture the full range of real-world structure, positional encoding must be spatiotemporal, not merely sequential.**

16. **All modalities ultimately describe *where and when* something happens, so a 4D positional code can unify them.**

17. **A truly general positional encoding treats inputs as points in spacetime, because that’s where everything that can happen must happen.**

18. **Since every phenomenon is embedded in 3+1 dimensions, a 4D position signal is the most expressive positional primitive we can choose.**

19. **Encoding 4D position is encoding the stage on which every task, object, and interaction is defined.**

20. **If your coordinates cover spacetime, your representations can cover existence.**





By adopting the standard transformer architecture, researchers implicitly commit to a fixed-index, fixed-context positional scheme. For single-task vision models—such as classification, detection, or image generation—this restriction is largely inconsequential, as the task structure, dimensionality, and invariances are known in advance and can be amortized over scale.

However, for unrestrained multi-task spatiotemporal learning, this architectural commitment becomes a dominant constraint. Expressing variable-dimensional structure, dynamic grouping, and cross-instance comparison within a fixed positional index requires increasingly long contexts, heavy padding, and complex attention approximations, driving up computational cost and model size.

In this regime, positional encoding is not the primary limitation but a proxy for a deeper architectural friction: the effort required to simulate flexible spatiotemporal structure within a fixed-index sequence model. The absence of a canonical positional encoding in vision is therefore best understood not as an unresolved encoding choice, but as evidence that the standard transformer interface imposes an unnecessary burden on unrestrained spatial reasoning.

---

**Short answer:** I mostly agree with the thrust of the argument, with one important qualification about *where* the constraint actually bites and *why* transformers have remained competitive despite it.

---

### Where I agree

Your core claim—that standard transformers *implicitly commit to a fixed-index, fixed-context interface*—is accurate and often underappreciated.

1. **Fixed-index sequence as an architectural commitment**
   Even with learned, relative, rotary, or implicit positional encodings, the transformer’s interface is still:

   * a flat sequence
   * with a fixed maximum length
   * addressed by index-based attention

   Positional encoding choices only modulate *how* indices are interpreted; they do not remove the fact that the model must *simulate* structure rather than *represent* it natively.

2. **Vision succeeds because structure can be amortized**
   In single-task vision settings (classification, detection, generation):

   * spatial dimensionality is fixed
   * invariances are known (translation, locality, scale)
   * the task distribution is narrow

   Under these conditions, the cost of flattening space into tokens is largely paid once, at scale. Patch embeddings + attention work because the model never has to *re-negotiate* the meaning of space.

3. **Unrestrained spatiotemporal learning breaks the illusion**
   As soon as you introduce:

   * variable numbers of entities
   * dynamic grouping and regrouping
   * cross-instance comparison
   * evolving spatial frames or reference systems

   the transformer is forced into:

   * longer contexts
   * padding and masking
   * quadratic or approximate attention
   * ad hoc routing mechanisms

   All of this is *simulation overhead*—not learning difficulty per se, but architectural friction.

4. **Positional encoding as a proxy problem**
   I strongly agree with your reframing:

   > positional encoding is not the primary limitation but a proxy

   The persistent lack of a “canonical” positional encoding in vision is a symptom of the deeper mismatch between:

   * flexible spatial reasoning
   * and a fixed-index sequence abstraction

   If the interface were right, positional encoding would be boring.

---

### Where I would qualify the argument

The one place I’d soften the claim is the implication that this makes the standard transformer *fundamentally unsuitable* rather than *strategically overused*.

1. **Transformers are interface-stable, not structure-optimal**
   The reason transformers dominate is not that they are ideal, but that they provide:

   * a uniform interface
   * massive tooling and hardware support
   * composability across modalities

   Researchers tolerate architectural friction because the ecosystem payoff is enormous.

2. **The model can internalize structure—but inefficiently**
   Large transformers *do* learn latent spatial graphs, object files, and temporal abstractions—but only by:

   * burning parameters
   * expanding context
   * relying on scale to smooth over mismatch

   This is why performance continues to improve, but cost curves look ugly.

3. **The real constraint is not position, but addressability**
   I’d sharpen your thesis slightly:

   > The bottleneck is not position, but **how computation is addressed**.

   Transformers can only attend by index.
   What unrestrained spatiotemporal reasoning wants is:

   * object-addressable memory
   * dynamic relational binding
   * variable-arity interaction

   Position just happens to be where the mismatch becomes visible first.

---

### A concise reframing

If I were to compress your argument into a single line I agree with:

> The absence of a canonical positional encoding in vision is not an open problem to be solved, but a signal that the sequence-based transformer interface is doing unnecessary work to emulate spatial structure it does not natively support.

That’s a strong and, in my view, correct diagnosis.

---

### Bottom line

* ✅ You’re right that positional encoding debates often miss the deeper issue
* ✅ You’re right that fixed-index sequence models impose hidden costs on flexible spatial reasoning
* ⚠️ The transformer’s persistence is less about correctness and more about ecosystem gravity

If you’re heading toward architectures that treat *structure as first-class* rather than *emergent from attention*, your argument is already standing on solid ground.

---

If it *is* an open problem, I’d restate it like this:

> **Find a positional (or more generally, coordinate) interface that lets a model generalize across vision tasks and spatiotemporal regimes with minimal architectural hacks, minimal context growth, and stable inductive biases.**

That’s genuinely open—*not* because we lack clever encodings, but because we don’t yet have a universally satisfying **contract** between geometry and computation.

Here are the strongest “it’s open” arguments, plus what a real solution would have to look like.

---

## Why it can still be an open problem

### 1) “Canonical” might mean *task- and scale-invariant*

For language, discrete order gives you a natural default. For vision, a good default would need to behave well across:

* resolutions and aspect ratios
* crops/augmentations
* multi-view or multi-camera geometry
* video frame rates / variable sampling
* dense prediction and sparse object reasoning
* 2D ↔ 3D transitions (images to world)

A positional scheme that is *truly canonical* would make those transformations “cheap” for the model.

### 2) The issue might be *representation*, not *architecture*

Even within a fixed-index transformer, the *right* positional representation could:

* reduce the need for long contexts by enabling better factorization
* make grouping/relations easier to express (e.g., via relative geometry)
* provide better extrapolation to unseen sizes and shapes
* stabilize attention patterns across scales

So yes: it’s plausible that we haven’t yet found the encoding that makes the sequence interface “good enough” for most spatiotemporal reasoning.

### 3) Vision’s “no canonical encoding” might reflect *missing priors*

Vision has multiple plausible geometric priors, and none fully dominates:

* translation equivariance (CNN-like)
* scale-space structure
* perspective/projective geometry
* object-centric coordinates
* scene-centric / world coordinates
* temporal coherence

If the right answer is a *blend*, the open problem is: **how do we combine them without brittle heuristics?**

---

## What would count as “solving” it?

A solved positional/coordinate interface would have most of these properties:

1. **Resolution extrapolation**: train at one size, run at many, no degradation cliff
2. **Transform consistency**: predictable behavior under crop/resize/rotate/time-resample
3. **Compositional geometry**: easy to express “part-of”, “same object”, “corresponds to”
4. **Cross-instance comparability**: align entities across images/videos without padding hell
5. **Efficiency**: doesn’t require quadratic attention over ever-growing token grids
6. **Plug-and-play**: works across classification/detection/segmentation/video/3D-ish tasks

If someone produced an encoding + minimal interface tweaks that reliably gave you these, people *would* call it canonical.

---

## Two ways the “open problem” could resolve

### A) A *better positional encoding* within the transformer

This would mean an encoding that effectively gives you:

* robust relative geometry
* multi-scale coherence
* maybe some notion of “frame” or “chart” selection

…without requiring the model to learn all of that from scratch.

### B) A *better interface* that makes “position” less central

If the breakthrough is actually an interface change (object-addressable tokens, dynamic sparsity, hierarchical routing, etc.), then “positional encoding” becomes canonical almost automatically—because the *units of computation* are no longer tied to a rigid grid.

In that world, the open problem wasn’t “encoding,” but encoding was the visible tip of it.

---

## Reconciling your original claim with “it’s open”

Both can be true depending on definitions:

* If “canonical positional encoding” means **a single best way to inject coordinates into a flat token sequence**, then it may indeed be a proxy for deeper friction.
* If it means **a stable geometric contract that enables broad generalization and efficiency**, then yes—it’s plausibly an open problem, and a valuable one.

So the sharpest version is:

> The open problem is not “which sinusoid,” but “what geometric *contract* should the model’s computational primitives obey?”

---

If you want, I can propose a concrete taxonomy of what “canonical” could mean (equivariance-based, correspondence-based, world-geometry-based, object-centric, etc.) and what empirical tests would actually distinguish “solved” from “merely competitive.”

Great — then we’re fully aligned, and it’s worth being very precise about what that implies.

If the goal is **a stable geometric contract that enables broad generalization and efficiency**, then the positional-encoding debate stops being about *signals* and becomes about *interfaces*. Below is a clean way to frame the problem, why it remains open, and what would actually count as progress.

---

## What “geometric contract” really means

A **geometric contract** is an agreement between:

* the *world* (space, time, objects, viewpoints), and
* the *model* (tokens, attention, memory, computation),

such that **geometric transformations in the world induce predictable, low-cost transformations in computation**.

Language has this:

* reordering → attention shifts
* syntax → locality patterns
* discourse → long-range attention

Vision does not—yet.

---

## Why vision lacks a stable contract

Vision violates three assumptions implicit in the transformer interface:

### 1) **Multiplicity of reference frames**

Vision simultaneously cares about:

* image coordinates
* object-local coordinates
* camera/view coordinates
* scene/world coordinates
* temporal coordinates

A flat positional encoding must choose one *privileged* frame. Any choice is wrong some of the time.

### 2) **Variable cardinality and granularity**

Objects appear, disappear, merge, split, and recur.
Tokens want to represent:

* pixels
* patches
* objects
* parts
* trajectories

A fixed tokenization + index scheme can’t change granularity without re-encoding the entire scene.

### 3) **Relational meaning dominates absolute location**

For most vision reasoning:

* “left of”, “same object as”, “corresponds to in next frame”
  matter more than
* “token index 1532”

A contract built around absolute indices forces the model to *derive* relations indirectly.

---

## Why positional encoding became the focal point

Positional encoding is where the contract *leaks*.

Researchers keep asking:

* absolute vs relative?
* sinusoidal vs learned?
* rotary vs ALiBi?
* 2D vs 3D vs separable?

Because none of these choices:

* eliminate padding and masking
* reduce quadratic blowups
* stabilize cross-resolution generalization
* make correspondence cheap

That’s the telltale sign of a missing contract.

---

## What a real solution would guarantee

A solved geometric contract would make the following *invariant or cheap*:

### Spatial guarantees

* Translation, scaling, cropping → predictable token transformations
* Resolution changes → no re-learning
* Multi-view alignment → shared latent geometry

### Temporal guarantees

* Variable frame rate → stable trajectories
* Long-range correspondence → sparse, persistent links
* Occlusion/reappearance → recoverable identity

### Computational guarantees

* Cost grows with *entities*, not *pixels*
* Attention is mostly sparse by default
* Grouping does not require re-encoding context

---

## What this implies about architecture

Here’s the key insight:

> **A geometric contract cannot be bolted onto a sequence model—it has to be partially enforced by the computational substrate.**

That doesn’t mean “throw away transformers,” but it does mean:

* Tokens must be *addressable by relation*, not just index
* Geometry must modulate *routing*, not just embeddings
* Grouping must be explicit or cheaply emergent
* Memory must persist across time and scale

In other words: **position becomes a property of interaction, not annotation**.

---

## Why this remains genuinely open

Despite many partial successes:

* CNN equivariance is too rigid
* Vision Transformers are too flat
* Graph models lack scale and efficiency
* Object-centric models struggle with realism
* 3D/world models require supervision or sensors

No existing approach satisfies:

> *flexible geometry × task generality × computational efficiency*

at once.

That’s the open problem.

---

## A precise restatement (you could publish this)

> The lack of a canonical positional encoding in vision reflects the absence of a stable geometric contract between perceptual structure and computation. The open problem is not how to encode position in tokens, but how to define computational primitives whose interactions respect spatial and temporal structure while remaining task-agnostic, efficient, and compositional.

That’s a clean, defensible, and important framing.

---

If you want to push this further, the natural next steps are:

* formalizing *what invariances must be cheap*
* identifying *which geometry should be explicit vs learned*
* designing *benchmarks that break flat token models*

I’m happy to help with any of those directions.


Good question — this is a subtle point, and it’s easy to overstate it if we’re not careful. Let me unpack exactly what I mean, and also where the analogy *breaks*.

---

## What it means for language to “have a contract”

When I say *language has a geometric (or structural) contract*, I don’t mean it’s perfect or innate. I mean that **the transformer’s native computation aligns unusually well with the structure of language**, so that *structure maps cleanly onto attention behavior* without architectural strain.

The three bullets are shorthand for that alignment.

---

## 1) Reordering → attention shifts

In language:

* Meaning is largely invariant to *where* words occur in absolute index
* What matters is **relative order and dependency**

If you paraphrase a sentence or move a clause:

* token identities stay the same
* relative relations change in small, local ways
* attention redistributes accordingly

Crucially:

* the sequence order *is* the linguistic axis
* “next token” is a meaningful primitive
* attention shifting is exactly what’s needed

So when you reorder language, you’re not fighting the interface — you’re using it.

---

## 2) Syntax → locality patterns

Syntax induces **mostly local dependencies**:

* determiners ↔ nouns
* adjectives ↔ nouns
* auxiliaries ↔ verbs

Transformers naturally express this as:

* high attention weight to nearby tokens
* occasional long jumps for movement or agreement

This matches the model’s bias:

* quadratic attention is affordable
* locality emerges without enforcement
* syntax trees are *implicit*, not simulated via padding or hacks

The sequence is already the right topology.

---

## 3) Discourse → long-range attention

Discourse phenomena (coreference, topic continuity, causal chains):

* are sparse
* occur at low frequency
* but require long-range links

Transformers handle this well:

* most attention is local
* a few heads specialize in long-range jumps
* cost grows, but meaningfully

Again, the *rare but important* long-range edges fit the attention pattern.

---

## Why vision does **not** have this (yet)

Now contrast with vision.

### Reordering in vision ≠ meaning-preserving

If you reorder image patches:

* you destroy spatial adjacency
* attention must *reconstruct* geometry
* invariance is not free

There is no canonical “next patch” primitive.

---

### Locality is ambiguous

Vision locality depends on:

* scale
* object boundaries
* depth
* motion

Two nearby pixels might be unrelated.
Two distant pixels might be the same object.

So “local attention” is often *wrong*, and “global attention” is too expensive.

---

### Long-range structure is dominant, not exceptional

In vision:

* object identity
* correspondence across frames
* part–whole relations

are **core**, not rare.

But attention treats them as expensive special cases.

---

## The deeper point

Language structure aligns with:

* a 1D sequence
* relative order
* sparse long-range links

Vision structure aligns with:

* multi-frame geometry
* dynamic grouping
* reference-frame shifts
* entity persistence

Trying to express vision through a language-shaped interface causes friction.

So when I say *language has this*, I mean:

> The transformer’s default computational primitives already match the dominant structural operations of language, whereas they only weakly and indirectly match those of vision.

That’s why:

* positional encoding in language is boring and settled
* positional encoding in vision is endlessly debated

---

## Where the analogy breaks (important)

This does **not** mean:

* language is solved
* transformers are optimal
* discourse/world modeling is easy

It means only that:

* the **index-based attention interface is closer to the natural structure of language than to that of vision**

That’s a contingent fact, not a theoretical guarantee.

---

## One-sentence distillation

> Language “has a geometric contract” in the sense that rearranging linguistic structure induces small, predictable changes in attention patterns, whereas rearranging visual structure often forces the model to reconstruct geometry from scratch.

If you want, we can go further and formalize this in terms of **topology alignment**, **graph sparsity**, or **information locality** — this is exactly where the argument becomes very sharp.
