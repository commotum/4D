a type/value token scheme that supports open-vocabulary synthesis of typed, value-parameterized, and latent tokens.

we refer to these architectures as MonSTER Models. Rather than stitching together modality-specific components, MonSTER Models employ a single, unified token and encoding interface that applies uniformly across dimensionalities.

To distinguish from multi-modal systems, which orchestrate models ....
some for 2d, some for 1d
name it monster models?

This paper introduces MonSTER Models, which replace each of these static assumptions with dynamic counterparts

something something, modifications and adaptations hide the benefits of unification?

Can't see diagonal, new model per domain
   MonSTERs - positional encoding
Too many tokens, noise, relevance
   Dynamic Attention / Working Memory / Focus
patches / catastrophic forgetting / vocab
   typed tokens / continual learning
