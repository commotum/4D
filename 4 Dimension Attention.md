### Abstract

The ARC-AGI benchmark, a set of visual reasoning tasks introduced by Fran√ßois Chollet in 2019, brought into sharp relief the jagged nature of state-of-the-art AI intelligence. Despite impressive linguistic capabilities, leading models demonstrated a pronounced inability to process or reason about visual information.

Rough:

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has achieved impressive performance across numerous cognitive benchmarks, yet these models persistently fail to adequately process, reason about, and generalize from visual and spatial data.
